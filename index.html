        <span>Mechanical Engineering is more than just gears, levers, and late-night CAD struggles—it’s about navigating a maze of courses, projects, and opportunities. The Mechanical Department Academic Mentorship Program (Mech-DAMP) is here to make that journey smoother (and maybe a little less stressful).Think of us as the bridge between experience and confusion: seniors sharing their hard-earned tips, mentors helping with academics, and faculty staying connected with students. From course reviews to project leads, Mech-DAMP is your pit stop for everything mechanical—minus the grease.</span>
