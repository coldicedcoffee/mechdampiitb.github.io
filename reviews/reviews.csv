The biology part consisted of the different systems like immune, digestive, nervous etc as well as some common diseases. The other part consisted of various digital systems in use in healthcare currently and some ML and DL techniques. The major objective of the course is to give engineering students sufficient background about biology and healthcare systems so they can use advanced analytics in this domain.","Minor, Elective, Recommended for sophies, Recommended for thirdies, Recommended for fourthies, Machine Learning and AI, Healthcare","The professor is quite interactive, and makes the lectures interesting, by providing anecdotes. He understands the students' perspective well and has thus adapted the content to make it relevant for us. He is also pretty chill and friendly, and accommodating of students' requests. Would definitely recommend that you take up any course he is offering. ","There were no assignments. There was a group project to be done in terms of 3/4. We could choose a problem statement from a given list or come up with a problem statement ourselves. The projects were centred around use of ML/DL techniques for healthcare domain. The prof had high expectations from the project and expected some novelty. The prof was willing to provide GPUs/any other help required for the project, and dedicated some lectures to guidance for the projects.","The exams were MCQ based, and were extremely straightforward, with questions asked directly from the slides. Most of the syllabus is information-based and thus the exam doesn't require any solving, but doesn't require too much rote memorization either. Some questions were asked from the project presentations of all the teams, which were slightly tough. Overall the exam was fairly straightforward and going through the slides a few times would have been good enough preparation.","This course doesn't directly act as a prerequisite, but it can be a good starting point for anyone interested in pursuing projects/courses in KCDH as this course will give a good overview of all the topics in this domain.","This course provides a good blend of biology, healthcare systems as well as ML/DL.

Although the slides are very clear conceptually, you will require a very good understanding of all the topics covered to score well in the exams. The programming assignments are challenging but totally worth it. It is recommended to take the course in the 5th or 7th semesters. Also, having done some first course in probability (EE325, SI427, SC629) is sure to be of great help. ","The programming assignments usually take quite a good amount of time to be completed and are dependent on the skill level of the student. The professor gives around two weeks to complete an assignment, and 20-30 hours is a good estimate of the hours you might have to put to finish an assignment on average. The endsem and midsem would need a good amount of studying to score well, as the questions are fairly mathematical, often requiring you to implement some algorithm, or even proving something covered in class. There are no quizzes. ","The grading was quite harsh. The professor generally keeps the cutoff for AA as 90+ and the policy for the rest of the grades isn't specified. Further, he is EXTREMELY intolerant and serious about plagiarism, even minor offences, and these scenarios are dealt by the CSE D-ADAC.

The course content is fairly mathematical and if you are comfortable with Linear Algebra and Fourier Transforms it can be easy for you. Although not very difficult to understand, there is a large amount of content and a lot of it is related. It is easy to lose track if you miss some classes or are not up to date. It is also coding heavy particularly in MATLAB. The slides and other course materials are well-made. People can ideally take the course in their 5th semester or 7th semester. Since I took the course in my 5th Semester, I was parallely doing Fourier Transforms through ME311 (Microprocessors and Controls) and this is turn made both courses easier. When I took the course, my peers were largely fellow 3rd year students in CSE, Electrical, Mechanical etc.","Moderate to High and Consistent time commitment is needed for the course.

,21,Gaurav Misra,SC629 - Introduction to Probability and Random Processes,Prof. Debasish Chatterjee,N/A,Autumn 2023-24,"Difficult: This course is not for the faint of heart. It is an introductory probability course. The instructor starts right from the basics but the learning curve is fairly steep. In other words, don't let the introductory nature of the course fool you, this is a fairly difficult course, not least because of the mathematical rigour involved. My motivation to take this course was to develop a good background in probability and to gain confidence in being able to handle math. The latter was definitely achieved, the former I'm not so sure about.
I would recommend people take this in their final year if they aren't enrolled in the placement process. Third-year students could also take it but please ensure you reduce academic workload elsewhere.","Heavy. The major time commitment would come from keeping up with course materials. This I would say would take up 5-6 hours (in addition to the 3 hours of classes) every week. Once that's done, no aspect of this course requires too much time commitment apart from the assignments. Those might take a couple of days to finish if one dedicates 3-4 hours per day.","Strict. The professor holds students to very high standards and that is reflected in his grading process. In the 2023-24 offering, only 1 student received an AA and 1 received an AB (it is worth noting this was out of a class of 14 students)","No attendance compulsory. However, people who do not attend this course will probably not be able to pass (this is not an exaggeration) unless they've already got a very good background in probability and statistics.

The prof. is the sole reason this course is worth taking. He's an extremely knowledgeable guy and knows how to teach. Since the class strength is low, he tends to speak directly to students sometimes, which could be intimidating. He entertains all doubts and prefers it when students ask questions, even when they're stupid questions. Most importantly, he routinely says comic things in class; in fact, I cannot recall a single class in which something funny wasn't said). Further, the discussions in class are not restricted to the subject matter. There have been plenty of instances when the professor is ready to break away and discuss something interesting a student has asked or wants to know about.
As I've mentioned before though, he is somewhat idealistic and holds students to the same standard as he does himself. Without question, he is strict.","Assignments are somewhat difficult, due to the number of problems involved (6-10, each one lengthy). The initial questions are easy, but those towards the end are tough. It would require roughly 2 days to solve provided you keep up with the material regularly. In any case, 3-4 days is more than enough. People generally tend to wait till the last minute before beginning assignments, though, which is seriously not recommended. The prof. will absolutely not approve any extensions in the deadline (the time given is actually more than enough if you begin early).","Keeping up with and revising the material regularly will literally result in just 1 hr of prep before exams, simply breezing over the technical terms.
If you've accidentally taken the course and are struggling with it, here's one piece of advice to keep in mind: The exams will never be as tough as the stuff he teaches in class. In fact, he mentions what he's going to ask in the exams during his classes and more often than not, he sticks to it. And other questions simply involve applying the basic concepts and remembering the terms. Also, the endsems will quite likely contain a bunch of questions pertaining to Markov Chains.","Any course which requires mathematical rigor will open up for you after this. Further, there are a bunch of courses related to the domain of probability offered by SC, IE and EE departments which can be taken. Further, for those of you who are interested in research and tend to come across math-heavy papers, interpreting math becomes much more intuitive once you finish this course.",This course is the sole reason I have gotten fairly good at dealing with and understanding math concepts.

People should prefer this course in 3rd year, if not then 4th year because the professor did not allow 2nd-year undergrads.

The course was heavy only in terms of the math behind the topics (sometimes challenging but worth visualising the results) which was quite elaborate and took some time to follow up. However, the good news is that the exams are not math-heavy but rather focused more on conceptual clarity.","In terms of time commitment, you can be assured of getting a good grade if you understand the concepts well since the assignments are hands-on with the concepts you have learned so far.

Midsems/Endsems - As already mentioned earlier, midsems/endsems are more conceptual based and a good grasp over the subject will make them a cakewalk for you.

Projects - An exclusive list of very interesting projects will be provided by the professor himself. You can choose from them or you can choose your own idea and discuss with the professor.

Along with that, if you want to learn MATLAB, this course can be a good start for you since all the assignments will be based on MATLAB simulations.","The professor is very to the point about his marking schemes and there would be very few instances where you could convince him about a change in your corrected sheets/assignment marks unless the concern is due to some other logistics.

Also, deadlines are to be strictly followed where the professor gives an extra window of 9-10 hours after the submission deadline without penalty (idk how he defines deadline lol) and no submissions by any means are accepted after that.",+91-7016601808,Y,Y

Assignment 1 is based on implementing counters and PWM on FPGA. Assignment 2 is based on speed control of a DC motor using FPGA and is hardware intensive (prior knowledge from ME 310 lab will help in this assignment). Assignment 3 is based on trajectory tracking of an autonomous bot in ROS which can be done easily once you have sufficient command over ROS (the theory is explained sufficiently well in the class itself). Assignment 4 is based on the state estimation of a bot in MATLAB/Python and was sort of challenging from a programming/implementation perspective since directly implementing the algorithm was slow and techniques were required to make the implementation faster. 

Assignments 1 and 2 had rather lenient checking. However, Assignments 3 and 4 had one of the worst checking methods because each point in the assignment report was scrutinized very strictly. Most people wound up getting 5-6 marks only out of 15 for assignments 3 and 4. 

The project was based on the implementation of non-linear control for closed-loop steering of unicycle-like robots. This involved reading a research paper and implementing the various algorithms mentioned in ROS.

",The averages for the midsem and endsem are usually on the lower side. The assignments are the major scoring parts. A few test cases are also provided to check whether your code is correct. ,"The exams are subjective. The midsem usually has 4-5 questions and the endsem 7-8. The papers cover the breadth of the course and go into conceptual depth. The endsem was mostly post-midsem. Past papers from almost the last 5-6 offerings are available on the course website, and attempting those is surely necessary if you want to try for a high grade (anything above BB) ","You can try courses like CS748 (project based and deeper version of CS747 offered by the same instructor), or EE6106 (goes into the depth of Multi-Armed Bandit theory). ","This course is a very good course to become adept at starting out with reinforcement learning. Most of the materials on the internet usually take a very shallow approach which does not give you enough insight into the algorithmic side of the topic. Reinforcement learning is a very up-and-coming field of AI, with a lot of research going on, and applications in robotics, trading, banking, and health care. Further, this course is avery much recommended if you are interested and curious about topics such as statistics, optimization and controls","I shall reiterate that the professor is very STRICT about punctuality and integrity, so ensure that you submit all evaluations on time and stay miles away from any breach of the code of conduct.

Key distributions such as Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Exponential, Gaussian, Rayleigh, etc were discussed in good detail.
","Minor, Recommended for sophies, Statistics, Real Analysis","Content was mostly taught in the traditional way - using board and chalk and was quite effective. We had to take notes as no other material was shared and the class notes were exhaustive enough. So you cannot afford to miss class. Apart from the lectures, we also had tutorial sessions held almost bi-weekly. We had the most amazing TAs and the discussions we had during the tutorial sessions helped develop a stronger sense of appreciation of the topics discussed in lecture hours. I would highly encourage everyone to diligently attempt the tutorial questions and be attentive during the discussions.

",N/A,"The quizzes and midsem were easy if you were well-versed with the homeworks and tutorials. The endsem was slightly tougher and required greater understanding and problem solving ability. All exams were open handwritten notes.

","Taking it in 2nd year would be most ideal so you can take advance probability and theoretical ML courses in later semesters.
If you enjoyed EE325, there are many electives in EE, CS, SI and IEOR that you might consider taking. Some of those are : EE621, EE734, IE708, CS747, IE618, SI404
","I loved Probability ever since it was formally introduced to me back in school and even during JEE. Also, the course fell in the DS-minor basket. 
I’d highly recommend this course to anyone who liked the probability taught during JEE or someone who is getting into theoretical ML. This is also a good starting course for anyone who wants to strengthen their quant. 

","Course Highlights

It’s a core course for the EE folks who usually take it in the odd semester. But it also runs in the even semester with a relatively small class size. This course is included in both the DS as well as EE minor baskets, so now you know who your peers are going to be :)

I strongly recommend not to miss any classes. Otherwise it becomes too difficult to follow the content in class or to cover on your own. ","Understanding notations and derivations can take some time. In fact, this is definitely not one of the “chill” electives people search for so take it only if you are genuinely interested and willing to put in time (Never miss a class!).

","The evaluation eventually consisted of a MidSem and an EndSem. However, this may change quite a bit in the subsequent offerings. That didn’t mean it required any less time commitment.
Having said that, something that helps is that the exams are open book/notes and easier compared to the rigor you are exposed to in-class. Also, the professor can tell you a lot about the Industrial scenario in Composites so feel free to ask him about that if you are interested. ","This course begins with some introduction of the mathematical frameworks such as Tensor Algebra, Fourier series, Greens’ function, etc. required for Micromechanical Analysis. Then, there’s a small recap of the Solid Mechanics concepts and discussions on Eigenstresses and Eigenstrains. A major focus of the course is characterizing and relating Inclusions and Inhomogeneities. Eshelby’s solution and Equivalent Inclusion methods are discussed in detail. Another major topic is the Average stress and Average strain theorem. In one of your labs, you might have seen the complicated expressions for estimating the Effective Moduli in Composites (using Voigt and Reuss Approximation and Mori-Tanaka method) as well as their upper and lower bounds. You can derive these expressions using what you’ll learn in this course. ","DD elective, Elective, Recommended for thirdies, Recommended for fourthies, Materials",The professor taught the course using the traditional black-board and chalk method and no slides or other material were shared.

The proofs asked in the exam were significantly less rigorous compared to proofs covered in class.
","If you like ME679, consider taking ME761: Advanced Stereology and Microstructural Analysis under the same professor in the subsequent Spring semester. You can also check courses on Composite materials offered by AE or MEMS departments.",Highly recommend this course if you are really comfortable with Linear Algebra and enjoyed ME201 and ME202 and/or are planning a DDP/BTP involving Composites/Micromechanics. It’s a plus if you are somewhat interested in Material Science.,"Pre-requisites
There’s no hard prerequisite but I’d highly advise you against taking this course if you are not comfortable with linear algebra or didn’t like ME201 or ME202.

Course Highlights
First class of the course we had a Quiz!
Discussions with the professor on the Industrial Scenario was an eye-opener.
In principle, you only need to know a few letters to navigate this course (attend first few lectures to understand what I mean :))

","Overall the course requires moderate time commitment. However, note that the course might get very hectic post midsem as there are 3 projects, two out which are simulation projects which might take a good amount of time if you have never simulated any process in Python/Matlab before. Hence, though the 1st half may require less than 1.5 hour commitment per week outside class hours, the 2nd half would require you to dedicate significantly more time.

","The course evaluation consisted of :
weekly quizzes (best 10/13 were considered), 
a Midsem, 
an Endsem, 
2 simulation projects (individual) and 
a Hands on project (in a pair)
","Select topics included - Laser fundamentals, Beam and Optics : CW, pulsing techniques, Beam Quality, Laser Matter Interactions - Fresnel Equations, Beer-Lambert Law, Photothermal Models for CW and Pulsed Lasers, Photochemical Processes, Laser Ablation, Macro Manufacturing using lasers - Cutting, Drilling, Welding, Forming, etc., Additive Manufacturing using Laser - SLM, SLA, Cladding, SLS, Micro and Nanomanufacturing using lasers - PLD, LSP, LIPSS, LIFT, 2PP, etc. The concluding lecture was on the Biomedical applications of Lasers - LASIK, skin treatment, Biomedical Implants, etc.
","DD elective, Recommended for thirdies, Recommended for fourthies, Manufacturing, Materials, Laser Optics","This course has a good amount of physics, particularly optics. It was a very well constructed course - the professor taught primarily using slides which were shared through Moodle and there was also a notion page with all details/updates about the course. The professor was genuinely interested in teaching throughout this course from the Physics of generation of Laser beams to the Application of Lasers in Biomedical Industry and was very approachable as well as cleared all doubts well. To firm our understanding, there were short moodle quizzes almost every Thursday.","The simulation projects involved coding in Python/Matlab to obtain the temperature distribution during laser heating, analyze the validity of thick and thin plate assumptions for different plate thicknesses as well as study the effect of process parameters such as scanning speeds and laser power on temperature profiles.
The hands-on project involved utilizing the femtosecond lasers to construct various micro-components. This won’t take much time as you would be guided by a TA who’ll be operating the system and demonstrating the process of using the laser system. 
The weekly quizzes were conducted on Moodle and were short (10-15 mins, MCQ/Numerical type, mostly formula based). 
",The midsem was relatively easy but the Endsem required a greater understanding of the concepts and the questions were mostly application based and some numericals were lengthy. ,"If you like ME677, consider taking an SLP/BTP under Prof. Marla. If you liked the Micro/Nano-manufacturing part of this course, consider ME6110 - Nanomanufacturing Processes. Other departments such as MEMS, PH also offer some relevant courses in Laser such as MEMS department’s MM718.
","I highly recommend this course if you are a core enthusiast or/and a CIM student as it opens a large variety of topics for your DDP. 
I was partly motivated by the laser portion of ME206 and partly by the fact that I was considering  getting LASIK done. Also ME677 lies in the CIM basket. I had also heard that there are plenty of good opportunities for the DDP in lasers.
","Course Highlights
A few interesting derivations, Applications in Micro/Nanomanufacturing and Biomedical Industry.
As an extension of this course, once the course ended, a few of us even got the opportunity to visit DRDO labs in Hyderabad.
