### General Recommendations: 
If you are fascinated by start-ups and plan to work on a venture of your own or if you want to get into the shoes of an entrepreneur, ENT courses are for you! Through various courses designed for effective learning, you learn the practical aspects of how a startup works - from looking for the right set of people to idea creation to the final prototype, essentially trying to
mirror a real case venture from scratch. In most of the courses, there are no written exams and grading is based on pitch or presentation.
Note that the demand for ENT electives is generally very high and it is harder to get certain courses as most people take it for the amazing grading statistics! It is not necessarily recommended to choose all the courses recommended for a particular semester, please take your time commitments and the credit limits into consideration.
