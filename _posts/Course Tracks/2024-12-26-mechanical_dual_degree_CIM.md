### General Recommendations: 
This course track is designed so that a DD student completes their prescribed course requirements before the final year, leaving the final year for the DDP as well as improving on grades in electives. The courses of choice are recommended by seniors after factoring in grading, workload, teaching and the overall course experience. Please note that the course track is just a recommendation from the DAMP team and is by no means exhaustive or restrictive. BTech Electives can be chosen as per the studentâ€™s interest, as long as the [BTech elective policy](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/e/2PACX-1vSDd2j821aqoPBrmaUkshYojBJgJ3e5PIEKslf340WiP0HLapIgH0p6plOmMAcWfMVp2NE7MXT3QqVg/pub) is followed. For students in Category I, it is possible to pursue a minor alongside this track.
