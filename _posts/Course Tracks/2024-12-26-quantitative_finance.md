### General Recommendations: 
There are quite a few interesting courses offered by the Mathematics Department under the SI label. However, SI courses have very strict prerequisites, hence you’ll have to start off with the compulsory courses. This isn’t a bad thing, but probably means that you should target completing the Statistics minor, since you’re going to be doing those courses anyway. There is an alternate route avoiding the SI courses, that can result in the completion of a Data Science minor. It may also be possible to complete both minors with an extended workload. It is not necessarily recommended to choose all the courses recommended for a particular semester, please take your time commitments and the credit limits into consideration.
