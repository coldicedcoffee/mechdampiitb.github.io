### General Recommendations: 
For the DH minor only the DH 302 (Introduction to Public Health Informatics) is compulsory. The courses are divided into three categories Group 1 (general BB, DH, ME), Group 2 (CS, EE), Group 3 ( HS, PS). Every student must take credit courses from at least two of the groups. An RnD project of 6 credits can be taken in lieu of a full semester course of 6 credits towards the completion of 30 credits to earn the MINOR degree. Do check the official [website](https://www.kcdh.iitb.ac.in/minor-program-healthcare-informatics) for the group of courses and plan accordingly.
