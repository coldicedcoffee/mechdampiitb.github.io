### General Recommendations: 
The best way to explore finance using the limited courses (as of now) in the institute is by pursuing a management minor, as well as a few other courses as electives. However, note that this is by no means exhaustive and there are several other routes that one can simultaneously take to obtain some sort of expertise in finance. This includes CFA, FRM, projects at
B-Schools, internships etc. Also, do note that the MG minor is extremely rigid, thus it becomes important to follow the track at each stage in order to complete the minor in time. It is not necessarily recommended to choose all the courses recommended for a particular semester, please take your time commitments and the credit limits into consideration.

### Preface:
It is recommended that students plan ahead for this minor due to inadequate faculty resources in some functional areas due to MBA and PHD student commitments. Other equivalent courses with SOM tag CANNOT be tagged for completing the minor!
