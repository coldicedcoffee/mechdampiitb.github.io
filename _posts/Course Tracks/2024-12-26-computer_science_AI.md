### General Recommendations: 
What distinguishes this plan from the Analytics track is the depth and research-based approach to machine learning and related topics. Completing a dual CS/DS minor would be the perfect outcome for someone looking to pursue careers in speech recognition, natural language processing, image processing and computer vision, robotics or data engineering. However, be warned that completing a dual minor is extremely hectic (at least for BTech folks) and requires a lot of commitment and motivation (donâ€™t try this at home!). It is possible to drop some courses off the plan and exit with a single minor degree. It is not necessarily recommended to choose all the courses recommended for a particular semester, please take your time commitments and the credit limits into consideration.
