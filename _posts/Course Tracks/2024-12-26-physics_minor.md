### General Recommendations: 
This minor can cater to diverse sets of interests ranging from quantum mechanics to solid-state physics to astrophysics to relativity. You need to do 5 courses of 6 credits each (30+ credits). There are three compulsory minor courses and you can select the other two courses from the basket of courses that the Department of Physics offers ([Handbook](https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/sites/www.phy.iitb.ac.in/files/handbook_physics_2024-2025_1.pdf)).

### 3rd Semester: 
- PH251: Classical Mechanics (or equivalent PH217 (EP core course))
- PH403: Equivalent of PH252

### 4th Semester: 
- PH252: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (or equivalent PH225 (EP core course))
- PH216(EP core course)/PH410/PH438:  Equivalent of PH253

### 5th Semester: 
- PH253: Thermal and Statistical Physics
- PH436: Equivalent of PH352

### 6th Semester:
PH352: Introduction to Condensed Matter Physics (recommended minor course)

### 7th Semester:
PH353: Light Matter Interaction (recommended minor course)

### Note:
- If you are comfortable with QM-I, you can skip that course, and take QM-II directly as an equivalent to PH252, so that you can complete PH540 Elementary Particle Physics as the 5th course of minor.
- Any quantum mechanics related course can be considered equivalent to PH252.  Any statistical physics course can be considered as an equivalent to PH253.
