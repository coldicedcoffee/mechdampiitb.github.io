### General Recommendations: 
Depending on your interests in the anatomy side versus the statistics and informatics side of computational biology, you can choose between the Digital Health and Biology minors. Nevertheless, there are a lot of common courses for those interested in a fair share of biology as well as statistics. It is not necessarily recommended to choose all the courses recommended for a particular semester, please take your time commitments and the credit limits into consideration.
