### General Recommendations: 
Looking to complete electives (2 Stem + 2 DE + 2 Hasmed + 5 Open) with minimum effort? Agnostic towards the course content? Looking for courses with chill grading statistics? This track is perfect for you! These are some courses that are reasonably popular for their minimal workload, lenient evaluation or both. This obviously comes with a disclaimer that these are purely based on historical statistics - there is no guarantee that all courses will be ‘chill’ for every future iteration!
Note that you need to complete at least 2 MExxx courses, at least 2 courses marked as ‘Interdisciplinary Stem’, 2 Hasmed and 5 Open electives It is not necessarily recommended to choose all the courses recommended for a particular semester, please take your time commitments and the credit limits into consideration.
