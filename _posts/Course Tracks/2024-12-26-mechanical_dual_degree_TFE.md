### General Recommendations: 
This course track is designed so that a DD student completes their prescribed course requirements before the final year, leaving the final year for the DDP as well as improving on grades in electives. The courses of choice are recommended by seniors after factoring in grading, workload, teaching and the overall course experience. Please note that the course track is just a recommendation from the DAMP team and is by no means exhaustive or restrictive. BTech Electives can be chosen as per the studentâ€™s interest, as long as the [BTech elective policy](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/e/2PACX-1vSDd2j821aqoPBrmaUkshYojBJgJ3e5PIEKslf340WiP0HLapIgH0p6plOmMAcWfMVp2NE7MXT3QqVg/pub) is followed. For students in Category I, it is possible to pursue a minor alongside this track.

### General Comments:
- ME769, ME661, ME678: Good grading
- ME678 about Compressible fluid dynamics, something which is only dealt with briefly towards the end of applied thermodynamics
- ME412: If anyone is interested in learning openfoam
- ME415: A good course for learning CFD theory and implementation in matlab; a very hectic course with tons of assignments quizzes and video lectures apart from regular lectures and midsems and end sem. Better alternative to learn CFD - AE780
- ME770: For basics of Ansys Fluent
- ME662: Pretty much an essential course if anyone is interested in pursuing higher studies in TFE. Builds strongly on concepts taught in elementary ME219 and ME346 including derivations of several famous correlations. Opens up avenues for further study in Turbulence and GFD/Instability
- ME681, ME684: Delves into air conditioning and refrigeration
- ME613: Not a fluid course but teaches students the Finite element method (704 teaches FDM while 415 teaches FVM) so it's a good course to get a sense of completion for numerical methods to solve differential equations. FEM has several applications in the domain of structural engineering and stress analysis.
- ME683: An introductory course on Cryogenics and its applications. Highly recommended after doing applied thermo.
- ME758: Microfluidics is a very niche and upcoming field with several applications in physics, bioengineering and cooling devices. It starts with concepts from 219 but becomes quite mathematical eventually. A strong recommendation for anyone interested in this field.
- ME680: A course on Two phase Flow and boiling phenomena. Would recommend it for anyone interested in learning about multiphase flows.
