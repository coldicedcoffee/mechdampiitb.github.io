### General Recommendations: 
UG students pursuing a Minor in Robotics can choose to complete all theory courses (e.g., five six-credit courses) or a combination of four courses and a six-credit mini-project. The mini-project can be undertaken individually or in teams (up to three students) from the same or different departments, encouraging a multidisciplinary approach. Theory courses must be selected from the baskets, with a minimum of one and a maximum of three courses from any basket: Design and Analysis of Mechatronic Systems, Guidance, Navigation and Controls, and Sensors, Actuators, and Embedded Systems. Check the course basket [here](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/sites/default/files/Minor_in_Robotics.pdf) and plan accordingly.
It is not necessarily recommended to choose all the courses recommended for a particular semester, please take your time commitments and the credit limits into consideration.
