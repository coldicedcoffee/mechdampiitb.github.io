### Application Process:
Application is usually released around start of May, online assessment had 2-3 different section (it had an arithmetic section, memory section and reaction speed section), these were fun and unlike other aptitude sections, in between each section you had to keep track of a string of blinking dots (better done than written), there was a huge HR section with over 100q, also questions there were repeated and you couldn't check previous answers, so keep that in mind while writing. And finally they took a resume of yours. Note: people who overperformed in the aptitude test were also not selected, so give it naturally.

Results of this round will be sent to you in 2-3 days (online automatic filtration based on the aptitude test) and around 20 days after that you got the final shortlist (2 rounds of filtration)

In the selection mail, you will be asked to fill a form with a tight deadline (less than 20 hours) so keep checking your mail.

### The Program: 
Spotlight had 2 branches, Technical and Supply Chain, the supply chain role  happened in Hyderabad over a span of a weekend, while the technical one happened on an adjacent weekend in Mumbai.

I went for the supply chain role to Hyderabad. Logistics were mainly handled by them, with plane as transportation and stay at Westin (5 star hotel).
We reached on Friday, and chilled for the day meeting the cohort (50 students from IITB, IITM, IITKgp, BITS Pilani, NIT Trichy-around 10 from each institute, though not exact), rooms were dual sharing.

Next day early morning went to the plant in a bus, had talks from industry leaders and plant owners (sleep well, dont dose away here ~guilty), then they batch you into 4 groups, and 2 groups went to see different supply chains independently  (pampers and whispers), the other 2 teams would play pre-planned activities there. Post all of this, around 4pm, they take you for another “Leadership talk” which is essentially one on one interviews with high level executives, the questions are usually resume based, situational and behavioural (what would you do if a teammate didn’t do work, tell one of the biggest challenges overcame etc). After this we went to a pre-booked venue for a buffet style dinner where a lot of PnG members were present and you could freely talk to them. then back to the hotel. Note most interactions of the day aren't evaluative (said by them), but I wouldn’t be too sure.

Next day early in the morning you again went to the plant, there was another visit to a product line (tide pods) and then only interviews, similar style as the first . After that they took us flight timing wise to the airport and you came back. 

Results were sent 20 days after all of this was done, and 4 days were given to give your final acceptance/rejection.

The interviews usually have a set format they look for and a very predictable set of questions, which your seniors may give you a better guide about if you are shortlisted ;)  

### Overall Experience:
You could take the experience in 2 ways, there were people who thought of it as a 2 day sponsored trip while there were ones who rigorously prepped the entire time. It's on you, additionally irrespective of the result you will have a lot of fun and make a lot of friends so enjoy.
