### How You Applied:
The opportunity came through a webmail announcement rather than the placement portal. Applicants were required to fill out a form detailing their interest, resume, CPI, and motivation for applying. Based on this information, candidates were shortlisted for interviews.

### The Interview Process: 
The selection process for Suntory reflected traditional Japanese hiring practices, making it a unique experience. Applicants had to submit an essay in addition to their resumes. Shortlisted candidates were invited for interviews conducted outside the campus recruitment system. This allowed me to manage my schedule and accommodate both P&G and Suntory internships on separate dates.
The interview process had three rounds:  
- Technical Round: Focused on my academic background, resume, and areas of interest.
- Motivational Round: Explored my reasons for pursuing the internship and my enthusiasm for working in Japan.
- HR Round: Assessed my general suitability and cultural fit.   

About a week after the interviews, I received the confirmation of my selection.

### Visa and Travel Assistance:
Suntory handled the entire visa process seamlessly. I only had to attend an interview at the embassy and collect my visa, both of which were smooth and hassle-free. Suntory assigned a dedicated person to assist with the process, ensuring everything was well-coordinated. The trip was fully funded. 

### The Experience in Japan:
My time in Japan was a perfect blend of learning, enjoyment, and cultural immersion. Suntory provided a fascinating insight into Japanese work ethics and culture. The team’s dedication was inspiring—they worked diligently from morning to evening and celebrated just as passionately after hours. Socializing was an integral part of the experience, with almost every evening spent enjoying drinks (sponsored by Suntory) and bonding with colleagues.
This internship left me with immense respect for Suntory’s work culture and values. It was an enriching experience, and for anyone offered a PPO, working at Suntory would be an exceptional opportunity.
