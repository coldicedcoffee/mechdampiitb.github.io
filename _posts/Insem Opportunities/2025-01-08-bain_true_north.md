I am Arya Jha, one of the recipients of the Bain True North Scholarship this year.
Talking about the programme, the selection process began with an application stage around April, where we were asked to submit an essay on "What True North means to you?", reflecting on a personal life incident that substantiated my perspective. Following this, we appeared for the online Bain SOVA (Aptitude) Test. Based on these two stages, I was shortlisted alongside four other students from IIT Bombay for the interviews which took place towards May end.
The interview process was rigorous yet immensely rewarding. I went through five interviews: four case-based and one HR/fit round. The case interviews included two guesstimates, one market entry, and one profitability analysis, each lasting approximately 30 minutes. The final interview, conducted by a Bain partner, extended to about an hour.
Throughout this journey, I thoroughly enjoyed the preparation process. It was my first dive into case-solving, for which I reached out to seniors, and collaborated with peers who were also preparing. I am incredibly grateful to everyone who helped me throughout the process.
They announced the results in the third week of June, and included a scholarship, a mentorship programme by Bain and a Pre-Internship Offer.
The overall experience has been truly transformative, enhancing my problem-solving skills, expanding my network, and preparing me for future challenges.
I am looking forward to making the most out of it ðŸ™‚

All of this began with a webmail we'd received in April regarding this opportunity. Just like any other IITB student would have, I took less than a minute to fill out the form and register for the same :)
By the time second year had ended, I was somewhat clear about pursuing a career in management consulting. 
Therefore, my natural inclination was to associate myself with an MBB firm, owing to the prestige and brand value they carry. However, when I considered Bain specifically, it definitely stood out because of its exceptional work culture and the continuous emphasis on mentorship. I believed that this program would offer me a holistic learning experience that would certainly help me in the future.
Winning this scholarship has indeed been a rewarding experience, offering tangible benefits and incentives. However, the preparatory phase (spanning two to three months) in itself has been incredibly transformative. The exposure to new perspectives, the learning opportunities, and the connections made with peers, seniors and mentors has added immense value to my journey so far.
