The BCG Bruce Henderson Ideathon is an ideathon for second-year B.Tech and third-year dual degree students. Conducted across leading IITs in India, the competition comprises three rounds, with prestigious rewards for the winners, including BCG internships—offered even before the official internship season—and other attractive prizes like gadgets. I had the privilege of participating in its inaugural edition, and since then, it has become a flagship annual event by BCG.

### Preliminary Round:
The competition started off with an individual online test for all registered participants. This test primarily assessed basic aptitude and data interpretation skills, with an additional video-recording task where we had to respond to a given scenario within a time limit. To prepare, I practiced sample BCG test questions available online, which proved sufficient. Interestingly, almost everyone who attempted the test made it to the next round, so there’s no need to stress too much about this stage.

### Submission Round: 
After the shortlist was announced, participants were required to form teams of three. It’s crucial to choose teammates who are not only serious about consulting but also people you enjoy working with—this makes the entire process more enjoyable and productive.
This round was unique in that teams could pick any business idea and were asked to present a comprehensive case covering aspects such as the problem to be solved, market size, market entry strategy, and competitor analysis. Our team selected a business idea related to implementing AI solutions in supermarkets—something we had prior experience with, giving us confidence in our idea.
Since only three teams from each campus advance to the semi-finals, standing out is critical. We invested considerable effort in researching and preparing a detailed, visually appealing presentation. Based on my experience, innovative and entrepreneurial ideas, combined with correct and detailed analysis, are key to success. Later, when I mentored teams for this year’s editions, I observed that those who excelled had out-of-the-box ideas and highly polished decks. Reaching out to previous finalists and reviewing their submissions can be helpful for understanding what works. Lastly, avoid last-minute slide preparation as it often results in subpar submissions.

### Semi-Finals:
Making it to the top three teams from IIT Bombay was a thrilling moment. The semi-finals involved presenting our idea to a BCG Project Leader. We divided the slides and conducted multiple rehearsals to ensure a smooth delivery. One valuable tip is to make an extensive list of potential questions, especially those targeting weaknesses in your idea, and prepare well-thought-out responses. Demonstrating deep understanding of the industry, the problem, and competitor strategies is key to this stage.
Our presentation went smoothly and the Q&A session felt more like an engaging discussion. The feedback from the BCG Principal was positive, and we were hopeful about advancing to the finals. Unfortunately, despite a strong performance, another team was selected to represent IIT Bombay at the national finals held at a BCG office. 

### Final Thoughts:
Though we didn’t make it to the national finals, the experience was immensely rewarding. The learning, combined with the time spent collaborating with friends, made it memorable. If you’re interested in consulting as a career—or even if you’re just curious and want to explore what it entails—I highly recommend participating in the BCG Bruce Henderson Ideathon. It’s an excellent platform to enhance your problem-solving skills and get a taste of the consulting world.
