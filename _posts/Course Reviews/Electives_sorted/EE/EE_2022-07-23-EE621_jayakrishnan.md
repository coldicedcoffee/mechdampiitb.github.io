#### Instructor
Jayakrishnan Nair

#### Semester
Autumn '21

#### Course Difficulty
With a strong background of first-year math and probability, the course shouldn't be too challenging. Rigor is, however, a constant feature, so if you're not a fan of long proofs and theorems, this may not be the course for you.

#### Time Commitment Required
Recorded videos were uploaded to YouTube and the lecture slot was used for discussion of the lecture content. This meant that a little bit of preparation was needed to follow the stuff taught in class.

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
Quite generous.  
15 AAs, 23 ABs and 19 BBs in a class of 83

#### Attendance Policy
None as such, however class participation counted for 5% of the grade.

#### Pre-requisites
EE325 is a semi-official prerequisite, but any other probability course from SC, IE or your own department should work alongside instructor's consent

#### Evaluation Scheme
Homework assignments – 25%  
Quizzes (2) — 20%  
Mid-term – 20%  
End-term – 30%  
Class participation – 5%  
Quizzes + assignments for audit grade

#### Topics Covered in the Course
As the name suggests, the first half is about Markov chains while the latter half looks at the modelling of queuing systems.  
Discrete-time Markov chains  
Introduction to Renewal Reward Theory  
Continuous-time Markov chains  
Markovian queueing models — M/M/1, Erlang B & C  
Phase-type distributions and Matrix Analytic Methods  
M/G/1 mean value analysis via Renewal Reward  
M/G/1 transform analysis  
Scheduling policies in M/G/1: FCFS, LCFS, PLCFS, SRPT  
Burke’s Theorem & Queueing Networks

#### Teaching Style
The professor would upload at least two videos every weekend and students were expected to have watched the content by the lectures on Monday and Thursday (one apiece). The professor was extremely patient and explained the concepts very well using a digital whiteboard. The pace was reasonably slow and the professor ensured that everyone in the class was awake with his enthusiasm. The use of real-word examples throughout makes going through the course content extremely interesting.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects
Homework Assignments - quite easy, avoid plagiarism at all costs

#### Feedback on Exams
Exams - rarely heavy on proofs or theory, unlike the lectures, easy to score well in if one does the homework diligently  
All exams were conducted using SAFE + web proctoring, with sporadic experiments with Code Tantra

#### Motivation for taking this course
Given my interest in Mathematical Finance, and how ubiquitous Markov Chains and other advanced probabilistic models are in financial market modelling, taking this course was a no-brainer

#### Course Highlights
The examples of queuing systems discussed in class, super-interesting

#### Course Importance
Great as an advanced probability course - once this is done you can branch out into Derivative Pricing, Stochastic Optimization, Stochastic Control or Statistical Machine Learning, for which there are a multitude of courses within EE as well as outside

#### How strongly would I recommend this course?
Great, if not for the amazing content but for the professor's teaching

#### When to take this course?
6th semester, ideally take it after you've done a proper probability course
