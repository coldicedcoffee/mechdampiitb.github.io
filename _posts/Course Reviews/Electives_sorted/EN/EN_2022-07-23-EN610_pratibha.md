#### Instructor
Prof Pratibha Sharma

#### Semester
Spring '21

#### Course Difficulty
The course is on the topic of Hydrogen energy, hence its based on the existing research in the past few years and tends to be extremely theroetical. All the basics right from the production till the possible end-use and implementation of hydrogen are covered. Difficulty wise, there isn't a lot that is very intellectually stimulating as one needs to just understand the theory developed which is very straightforward and logical. My personal motivation to take the course was to understand the nuances of this field as hydrogen is one of the futuristic fuels even from a green economy perspective
