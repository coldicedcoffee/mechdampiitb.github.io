#### Instructor
Hemendra Arya

#### Semester
Spring'20

#### Course Difficulty
Easy to Moderate. The content was really Interesting and unique.

#### Time Commitment Required
Just need to attend the lectures.

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
Everyone was given a AA/AB

#### Attendance Policy
No attendance requirements

#### Pre-requisites
No pre-requisites 

#### Evaluation Scheme
The course had a midsem, endsem and a group project. No quizzes. The endsem and midsem had a few questions which were based on the project.

#### Topics Covered in the Course
Systems definitions and concepts. Conceptual system design; Introduction to engineering design and decision making; Requirements capture; Requirements analysis, functional decomposition; System architecture; Quality Function Deployment; Queuing theory; Design options; Monte Carlo modeling; Utility theory; Forecasting. Engineering systems modeling. Analysis of system: Reliability; Maintainability; Serviceability; Disposability and Affordability. Cost and benefit analysis. Methods of decision analysis; State transition matrix models; Modeling the research and development process;Information, System life-cycle modeling and optimization. Game theory;Management of engineering systems design and operation; Programmemanagement with case studies.

#### Teaching Style
The prof had a guest Speaker from the industry come and give weekly lectures. Apart from this we had a course project running where we had to directly apply the knowledge we gained from the lectures

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects
The project was a bit time consuming but had the maximum weightage and we did not have to prepare for the exams if enough research was done for the project.

#### Feedback on Exams
The Exams were case based and no mugging up was required in any of them. If one had attended all lectures, nothing else was required

#### Motivation for taking this course
I was a part of the Student Satellite Team. The content of the course was directly applicable to the project I was working on.

#### Course Highlights
The project helped me understand the course a lot better. 

#### Course Importance
The course content was really unique and hands on. The prof was really flexible with submissions and the guest lectures were really interesting.

#### How strongly would I recommend this course?
Really enjoyed the course, would definitely recommend it 

#### When to take this course?
I took this course in my 4th Semester. As there are no pre-requisites/associated courses, can take this up in any semester.

#### Going Forward
This is a basic course on systems engineering and the only course in this domain that IITB offers according to my knowledge hence it can be used as a great opportunity to explore the field. 

#### References Used
Only the lecture slides.
