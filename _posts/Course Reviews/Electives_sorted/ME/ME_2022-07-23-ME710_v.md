#### Instructor
V. Kartik

#### Semester
Autumn' 20

#### Course Difficulty
The course focuses on downright basics and the difficulty linearly increases throughout the semester. But overall the concepts are not difficult to grasp if one is even a little attentive in class.

#### Time Commitment Required
Weekly 1 hr self study would be enough

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
The top 30-40% was given AA or AB and the grading was lenient. 

#### Attendance Policy
None

#### Pre-requisites
KDoM is not an official prerequisite, but the course builds off the latter part of KDoM

#### Evaluation Scheme
Included 3 quizzes comprising of 20 marks, 30 marks for project and 50 marks for endsem exam

#### Topics Covered in the Course
The courses focuses on developing the basics needed to formulate equations of motion for any given system by converting it into a spring, mass and damper system. Towards the end there is some focus on equations relating to damping and some theory related to vibrations but all in all the courses focuses on problem solving going by the fundamentals. The course involves a project which requires some effort and can be done in groups. The exams were also held in groups.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects
Project was quite intensive and involved significant modelling and programming components

#### Feedback on Exams
Exams could be quite complicated, particularly in the latter half of the course
