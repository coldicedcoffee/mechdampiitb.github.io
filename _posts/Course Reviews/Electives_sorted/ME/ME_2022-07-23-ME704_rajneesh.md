#### Instructor
Rajneesh Bhardwaj

#### Semester
Autumn' 19

#### Course Difficulty
The equations are straight forward and some basic programming would be enough for all the assignments. Involves lengthy calculations in the endsem exams.

#### Time Commitment Required
4-5 hours a week

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
Grading is neither lenient nor very stringent.

#### Attendance Policy
None

#### Pre-requisites
None

#### Evaluation Scheme
Coding Assignments: 30 marks, Endsem exam: 40 marks, Midsem exam: 20 marks, Quizzes: 10 marks

#### Topics Covered in the Course
Finite element related equations and concepts like forward difference, Runge Kutta method were taught. The different types of numerical formulations were compared and their significance was shown in class. Students were required to learn how to apply the taught methods rather than going into details of the theory.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects
Coding assignments were quite straightforward if one had prior programming experience

#### Feedback on Exams
Exams were quite lengthy and involved lots of calculations

#### Motivation for taking this course
Basics of computational science, if you enjoyed MA214 then this course is for you
