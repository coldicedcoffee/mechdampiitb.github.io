#### Instructor
Abhilash Chandy

#### Semester
Autumn '20

#### Course Difficulty
Quite easy

#### Time Commitment Required
Hardly any effort required, provided you have done ME219

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
Grading was absolute, but the papers were quite high-scoring, so many people had 90+.  
27 AA, 14 AB, 21 BB out of 95 students.

#### Attendance Policy
None

#### Pre-requisites
None, since the course actually runs as an introductory course for PG freshmen.

#### Evaluation Scheme
Assignments - 20% (5/6)  
Quizzes - 20% (5/6)  
Endsem - 60%

#### Topics Covered in the Course
Continuum concept, control volume equations, Ideal fluid flow and hydraulic singularities, Navier-Stokes equations, and their use. Concept of compressible flow, one dimensional isentropic flow, normal shock, flow with-friction, heat transfer, boundary-Layer theory and applications

#### Teaching Style
Classes were conducted live on Microsoft Teams.  
The professor would read his slides and annotate over them, so the classes were reasonably interactive. Attendance was quite poor though, since most of the UGs found the course content to be a repeat of ME219.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects
Assignments were very simple, picked straight out of the reference book.

#### Feedback on Exams
Really easy, most of the questions in the quizzes and endsem are straight from the reference books.

#### Motivation for taking this course
Chill department elective :)

#### Course Importance
One of the core courses for TFE Dual Degree students, so it will be handy for those looking at research in the TFE domain.

#### How strongly would I recommend this course?
Not much learning, but if you're looking for a chill elective as a repeat of ME219 then this is a good choice.

#### When to take this course?
5th semester. Ideal time to take the course.

#### Going Forward
A basic course in fluid dynamics opens up a large array of opportunities in TFE. A logical next step would be to take a course in CFD.

#### References Used
