#### Instructor
Mrinmoyi Kulkarni

#### Semester
Autumn '21

#### Course Difficulty
Low to Medium difficulty, depending on your ability to remember and memorize

#### Time Commitment Required
Very Little apart from some time before the exams. The assignments given also took very little time around 30mins to 1 hr each.  
No weekly commitment required apart from the classes.

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
Very Lenient grading policy, compared to the other section. 

#### Attendance Policy
No attendance policy due to online semester

#### Pre-requisites
None

#### Evaluation Scheme
30%- Midsem  
30% - Endsem  
Initial plan included small surprise quizzes totaling to 30% and a 10% reading assignment which was then modified to   
10% - 3 assignments each, including the reading assignment  
10% -  one small quiz

#### Topics Covered in the Course
Basics of psychology. Topics include  
Memory  
Nature and Nurture  
Brain  
Consciousness  
Sleep  
Learning  
Intelligence  
Cognitive Development  
Motivation  
Personality  
Mental Illnesses, etc

#### Teaching Style
Teaching style and pattern very similar to the reference book Morgan & King

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects
3 assignments were given  
1 - write about a childhood memory  
2 - Read the book 'Mans search for Meaning' by Viktor Frankl and write how can you relate it to your life  
3 - Please write about a page about what motivates you -  prior to the lockdown  (e.g  studying for the JEE etc )  
And during the lockdown - how did you get motivated?  
  
All the assignments were pretty simple and did not consume a lot a of time. But they needed to be written with care since each assignment carried a lot of weightage. However lenient marking was done for all of these hence that was not an issue.

#### Feedback on Exams
Had MCQ exams on SAFE, which were based on the matter taught on the class. Used of concepts was required and not just rote memorization, however there was a significant component of memorization also.

#### Motivation for taking this course
Since a HSS elective is compulsory, this was a good choice due to light content and good grading

#### How strongly would I recommend this course?
As a HSS elective this is a good course with a balance of good grading and interesting content. Hence advisable

#### When to take this course?
Ideally to be taken when your HSS elective needs to be taken, mostly in the autumn semester of the third year.

#### Going Forward
There are some advanced psychology courses running in the institute that people can take after this one.
