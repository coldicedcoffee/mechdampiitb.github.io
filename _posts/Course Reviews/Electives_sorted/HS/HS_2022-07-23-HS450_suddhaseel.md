#### Instructor
Prof. Suddhaseel Sen

#### Semester
Autumn '21

#### Course Difficulty
The course was not difficult for those who had an idea about music, especially vocals. For those playing instruments, it might be a little difficult because everything is hearing based. 

#### Time Commitment Required
2-3 hours outside class hours per week

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
AA	10  
AB	4  
AU	7  
BB	10

#### Attendance Policy
No policy

#### Pre-requisites
Vocals training (good listening skills), any instrument (classical instruments will definitely be beneficial)

#### Evaluation Scheme
4 quizzes: 25 marks each

#### Topics Covered in the Course
Intervals, Rhythm (meters), Instruments of the Orchestra, Chords, Cadences, Textures in Music

#### Teaching Style
Sir would primarily talk about the concepts and play several tracks as examples. The class was very interactive and sir encouraged such discussions.

#### Feedback on Exams
The quizzes were completely audio based where we had to answer questions based on tracks. They were all fill in the blanks. Having a prior vocal training would go a long way (either Western/Classical).

#### Motivation for taking this course
I enjoy music - both listening and playing various instruments. I wanted to do a theoretical/ more technical course that included analysing various topics so this seemed to be the natural choice. The professor had taken HS305 for me and I was already well versed with his teaching style. 

#### Course Highlights
Audio based learning of various topics in musicology including chords and rhythm (basics) to more technical concepts like textures and timbre.

#### Course Importance
The course is useful is you want to pursue musicology or want a general perspective on music analysis.

#### How strongly would I recommend this course?
I would strongly recommend the course to anyone who has studied music before and wants to stay in touch with the subject.

#### When to take this course?
Autumn '21 (first time it was running) - the course can be taken anytime after the first year because it is unrelated to other HS/STEM courses.

#### Going Forward
HS 642 is the natural successor to the course - it introduces advanced topics including staff notation.
