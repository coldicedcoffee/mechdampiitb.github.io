#### Course Difficulty
The course covers useful statistical concepts that have practical applications in data analysis. If followed with class, the course difficulty level would seem a 3/5

Since the course has a short quiz every week, keeping up with the course becomes fragmented and hence easy

Attendance was not compulsory but every week there was a short quiz with one or two questions which served as attendance for the week. 

#### Topics Covered in the Course
Course various statistical distributions that have applications in data analytics

#### Feedback on Exams
The exam questions were very similar to tut and short quizzes but were a bit lengthy and grading was relatively chill
