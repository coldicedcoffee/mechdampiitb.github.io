#### Instructor
B.K.Mohan

#### Semester

The course is easy to follow 

#### Time Commitment Required
1 or 2 hours besides lecture

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
Lenient , easy to score BB or better with minimal efforts

#### Attendance Policy
None

#### Pre-requisites
None but a machine learning course would be quite helpful

#### Evaluation Scheme
There were 3 quizzes with 5% weightage each, a paper review and programming assignment (25%),midsem (20%) and endsem (40%)

#### Topics Covered in the Course
 The course begins with basics of Satellite images and multispectral images, then some basic algorithms used in image processing were discussed. Some algorithms like K-SOM which are not conventionally used were also taught and towards the end, the machine learning approaches were taught

#### Teaching Style
The professor uses slides to teach and explains the concepts quite well. 

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects
The project involves implementation of some algorithm taught in the course 

#### Feedback on Exams
The quizzes consisted of 5 one mark questions and were generally easy and based on direct statements in the slides  
The midsems and endsems contained bigger questions but were still directly based on slides . Generally questions like explain a particular algorithm and mention it's advantages and disadvantages were asked. All questions were non numerical
