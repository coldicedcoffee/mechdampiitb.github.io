#### Instructor
Deepanshu Bansal

#### Semester
Autumn '20

#### Course Difficulty
Content wasn't easy. It was meant to be for Masters students, hence some knowledge gap was noticeable in the lectures. Covering this gap required a bit of extra effort.  
In some sections, it was difficult to understand what was the motivation behind the concept. 

#### Time Commitment Required
Although no midsem and endsem, the quizes(6) took some time to prepare (4-5 hours each quiz). The assignments were time consuming (10 hours each) and preparing for the vivas also took quite some time.

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
Decent stats. 

#### Attendance Policy
No attendance required, atleast in an online setting.

#### Pre-requisites
Basic coding(loops,numpy arrays) in any language, preferably python-helps you collaborate with others.  
There is no coding test, its just required for assignments

#### Evaluation Scheme
No midsem/endsem  
  
Best 5/6 (8% each) quizes  
4 assignments (15% each)- each has a viva

#### Topics Covered in the Course
Lattice dynamics
