Grades being submitted without revealing project marks(50% weightage)

#### How strongly would I recommend this course?
Take only if Prof. Sumit Saxena is the instructor.

#### When to take this course?
Can tag as elective directly, and if willing to do that, sem3 would be ideal, before intern season.  
If tagging as ALC, any odd sem works
