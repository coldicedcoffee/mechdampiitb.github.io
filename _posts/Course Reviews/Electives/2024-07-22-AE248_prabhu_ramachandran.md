#### Grading Policy and Statistics

Decent. 21% of the students were awarded an AB or above.

#### Attendance Policy

There was a strict attendance policy of 80%, failing to comply to which would result in a DX grade.

#### Teaching Style

The professor taught us through slides as well as a reference book which was followed throughout the course.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects

There were 3 assignments which were distributed across the semester. There was also a project towards the end of the semester. The assignments and project were relevant to what was being taught in the class and asked in the assignments.

#### Course Importance

This course is an introductory course into the statistically aspects of Machine Learning. It also sets a foundation of Machine Learning and its practical applications. Covers some concepts in detail but does not cover all fundamental concepts in Machine Learning. A little more on the mathematical side of ML. Even the quizzes and exams are straight up probability and statistics question based on ML.
