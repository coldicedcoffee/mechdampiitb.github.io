#### Teaching Style
Lectures were made available on the YouTube channel made by the prof for the course. Doubt/Discussions sessions were held every Wednesday and tutorials sessions were held on Fridays. Excellent lecture slides were also  made available by the instructor which were used in the YouTube lectures . The professorâ€™s teaching style was easy to understand, and the material covered was quite interesting and intellectually stimulating. The lectures were, for the most part, evenly paced. The professor encouraged doubts and always cleared them up quite effectively.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects
 I found the tutorial problems very intriguing. We were given the problems beforehand and encouraged to solve them before the session, where they were discussed in detail.

#### Feedback on Exams
The examinations were neither too easy nor too hard. Solving the tutorials and following the lecture slides did help a lot . 

#### References Used
Lectures slides and video lectures were enough.
