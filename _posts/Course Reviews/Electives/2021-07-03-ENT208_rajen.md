#### Instructor
Prof Rajen Jaswa

#### Semester
Spring '20

#### Course Difficulty
The course wasn't difficult. It mainly was thinking about an idea, discussing about it and presenting it.

#### Time Commitment Required
Although the classes were optional, some events and talks were super fun to attend. Do attend if an external speaker is invited.

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
Not as chill as other ent courses. So if you're looking for a free grade, please find another ent course.

#### Attendance Policy
Optional

#### Pre-requisites
None. If you have a group of 3-4 with you, it becomes easier than to make a random group.

#### Evaluation Scheme
Presenting your start-up project's progress. Lite only.

#### Topics Covered in the Course
TVC is like a crash course of the whole ent minor. It's the capstone course of ent. Also, there's trip to a rural setting involved here, sponsored by DSSE itself. Spring '20, they took us to a village in Ahmedabad to interact with the community and understand their problems. This was to enable us to come up with ideas solving tech related issues, specifically for villages.
