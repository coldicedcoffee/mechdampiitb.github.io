#### Instructor
G Sivakumar

#### Semester
Spring'21

#### Course Difficulty
The course difficulty was moderate. Professor rarely took any classes and mostly posted online links for the topics, but the content was pretty interesting in itself, hence many peeps enjoyed reading it on their own. The course had a big chunk for the project and hence it was easy to score good marks and grade if one does well into that. 

#### Time Commitment Required
2-4 hrs self study every week

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
Great. The course's grading was very chill in our sem.

#### Attendance Policy
There were rarely any live lectures (online mode) and hence no attendance.

#### Pre-requisites
Having knowledge about Computer Networks (CS-224) can be a great plus point.

#### Topics Covered in the Course
Vulnerabilities, risks, attacks, defences, forensics, Cryptography, Network/host intelligence gathering, Web security â€“ SQL injection, Access Control, firewalls and host/network intrusion detection

#### Teaching Style
Professor used to post links for the topics to be covered and there used to be very less live interactions.
