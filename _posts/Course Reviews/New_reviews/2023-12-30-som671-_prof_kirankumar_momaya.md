#### Instructor
Prof. Kirankumar Momaya

#### Semester
Autumn 2022-23

#### Course Difficulty
The course is from moderate to difficult. I took it in 3rd year but I would recommend to take in 4th year(7th semester)

#### Time commitment needed
Attendence was graded and project required good amount of time commitment. So weekly 4-5 hrs

#### Grading Statistics
Grading was good overall but margins were kept too close so for similar efforts, grades did vary between AA-BB. 
Total Grades Given 
AA	7
AB	10
AP	1
BB	17
BC	5
CC	5
CD	2
DD	12
FF	2
Total	61

#### Attendance Policy
Attendance was graded

#### Teaching Style
Most of communication would happen through  moodle. Teaching for this course was mainly on blackboard and through slides (not all slides would be shared) , also a booklet was provided by the professor for readings. My personal experience was that it was very difficult to find relevance from the booklet, but we mainly used it at exam time only

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
The course included the mini project which had a weightage of 40%, so it was the most time consuming part of the course. The project required extensive work and research for the concept paper, thus the time commitment. The project submission had multiple stages, so time commitment was divided throughout the semester. Grading of the project for entire class was tough. If you are enthusiastic, it is recommended that you participate in the competitions suggested by the professor.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
Exams included both subjective and objective parts, grading of exams was comparitively easy so it can be rated moderate. Subjective questions included theoretical, application of concepts to mini project firm and few open ended questions as well. Preparation time-wise, studying one or 2 days prior to the exam was sufficient.

#### Future Tracks
According to professor this course is good per-cursor to the course- Sustainable Competitiveness (where internsity of work on the project firm is one step higher) 

#### Course Importance
 I took the course to get a broad idea of benchmarking and competitiveness study in corporate firms, mainly technical field. So broadly, it might give a rough idea about such a study, but a very rough idea.
