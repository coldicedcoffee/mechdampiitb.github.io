#### Instructor
Prof. Vivek Sangwan

#### Semester
Spring 2022-23

#### Course Difficulty
Moderate

#### Time commitment needed
The course doesn't have compulsory attendance, but it's necessary to attend lectures to do well since the prof usually asks questions straight from the lectures in the exams

#### Grading Statistics
Great, 10 AAs in 19 students

#### Teaching Style
The lectures were very well organized, and prof was receptive to a lot of doubts. Lectures were timely uploaded to Moodle.

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
Assignments take up a good chunk of time; Project is usually a presentation of use of a topic taught in class (for us it was SVD). The project doesn't take a lot of time, it's just a paper review assignment but the prof has a strict time limit on how long the presentation should last.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
Exams are fairly easy if you attend classes; Note that this is kind of an advanced linear algebra course so having some grasp over the topic goes a long way.

#### Future Tracks
Controls, ML, any course that would apply Linear Algebra

#### Course Importance
Someone moving into the ML space should do this course; usually in their 6th sem (helped me a lot for placements) since the course dives deep into the basics of linear algebra and matrix operation which form the basis for machine learning
