#### Instructor
Prof. Sudha Shastri 

#### Semester
Autumn 2023-24

#### Course Difficulty
Depending on your interest and grasp of literature. Without a decent level, would be difficult, otherwise moderate. 

#### Time commitment needed
4-5 hours a week. 3 hours of classes + extra readings given for the next class with ~30 mins per reading. 

#### Grading Statistics
Good grading, almost all AAs and ABs (probably due to small class size) 

#### Attendance Policy
Not compulsory but highly recommended to attend 

#### Teaching Style
The plays were read and discussed in class. Sometimes readings were given in advance, and doubts and discussions would happen in the class. Some afterlives were movies, which were again to be watched beforehand and discussed in class. 

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
Moderate 

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
Exams were fully subjective and based on understanding and interpretation of the plays and their afterlives.

#### Additional Details
Take this course purely if you have an interest in literature, want to explore Shakespeare and can dedicate a little extra time in the semester. It's very interesting and a good break from the regular engineering courses :)
