#### Instructor
Prof. Krishnendu Sinha

#### Section
Minor

#### Semester
Spring 2022

#### Course Difficulty
Easy (2/5)

#### Time commitment needed
The course is a lightweight which required prep only one day before the exam. The professor had shared tutorials and their answer keys and most questions in the exam were based on these questions (same concept, not same question)

#### Grading Statistics
Grading was moderate with
Total Grades Given for core are	79
AA	5
AB	13
BB	18
BC	13
CC	15
CD	6
DD	4
FF	2
FR	2
II	1
Total	79
Total Grades Given for section M are	8
AA	4
AB	2
BB	1
DD	1
Total	8

#### Attendance Policy
Attendance above 80 percent constituted 5 percent of the marks

#### Teaching Style
Prof. was chill and most classes were a fun interaction. The prof used real engines and their parameters to do case study type teaching for each topic

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
There were no assignments, but there was a group project which was to chose an engine of our own choice and analyse its thermodynamic variables at every point. This was not very hard

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
Midsem was mainly conceptual and involved complete understanding of the concepts in detail. Endsem was slightly more chill and had 10 MCQs and a few long questions

#### Future Tracks
This course is a good course especially for Mechanical students to take as they have already studied thermodynamics (which makes the first half of the course very easy) and also provides a real life application to learnt concepts

#### Course Importance
A good introduction to propulsion, although not very mathematical or in depth

#### Additional Details
This course got me interested in the Aero minor and is quite good to take in 4th sem since it is also very chill and light
