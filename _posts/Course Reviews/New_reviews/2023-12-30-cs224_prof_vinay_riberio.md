Easy. The contents of the course are not that difficult to follow however they can seem to be too theory-heavy. It is recommended for sophomores and above.

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
Assignments were moderately difficult but were manageable with the core course load. The time commitment is not as intense as many other CS courses.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
Preparation time would vary depending on activeness in the course but since it covers theory, it is easy to follow. Most questions are based on understanding of the architecture or algorithms used and are not tough given some practice.

#### Future Tracks
This can be a great start for your CS minor if you are considering it.

#### Course Importance
This course does not involve a lot of coding and might come as a respite if you are taking heavier courses alongside. It gives a very good idea of how networks have evolved over the years.

#### Additional Details
The course ends on a very good note because one gets an idea of how the different layers work together in various applications from messaging to torrents.
