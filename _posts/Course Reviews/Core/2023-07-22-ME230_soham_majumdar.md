#### Instructor

Sohum Majumdar

#### Section

#### Semester

4th

#### Course Difficulty

Medium

#### Time Commitment Required

A Typical Gaussian Distribution. Top 30 percent received grades above BB

#### Attendance Policy

Initially 80% attendance policy with 5 percent grade penalty. Was later removed based on popular demand.

#### Pre-requisites

None, but knowledge of ME221 is required.

#### Evaluation Scheme

Quizzes: Weightage 30%; Best 3 out of 4
Midsem: 20%
Endsem: 40%  
Assignments: Individual submission; 2 in number of 5% each

#### Topics Covered in the Course

A great introductory course in Manufacturing. The concepts covered form the basis of future manufacturing courses.

#### Teaching Style

Excellent Delivery of Lectures.MS Teams is the key medium for communication. Slides are used while teaching. Slides are quite detailed having all the necessary information to do well in the course.Additional practice problem sets are also provided before the exams.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects

Assignments ( Individual submission, 2 in number of 5 percent each): 2 assignments which won't take much time if you are familiar with Matlab and Abaqcus Simulia Softwares.

#### Feedback on Exams

Quizzes( Weightage 30 percentage) ( Best 3 out of 4): These are typically on the easier side. Completing 100 percent of the quizzes in time is a challenge. A thorough revision of the lecture slides would fetch great marks.
Mid-term / Endterm( 20 percent midterm + 40 percent endterm): A mix of numericals and theory questions are asked. The numericals are pretty much the same ones being given in the lecture slides with data change. Time is sufficient for these exams. Just avoid silly mistakes.

#### Going Forward

ME 677 (Laser Material Processing), ME730 ( Ultra Precision Manufacturing) , ME750 (Sheet Metal Engineering)

#### Other Remarks

Regularly attending lectures and getting your doubts clarified would put you in a good position to score well.
