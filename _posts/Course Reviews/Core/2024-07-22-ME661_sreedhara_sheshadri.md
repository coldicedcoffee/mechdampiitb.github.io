#### Instructor
Sreedhara Sheshadri

#### Semester

7th

#### Course Difficulty

2/5

#### Time Commitment Required

None

#### Grading Policy and Statistics

Grading was good. More than 50% of the class had a BB grade or higher

#### Attendance Policy

None

#### Teaching Style

The prof. delivered the course content through lecture slides. The content was uploaded on Moodle in advance of the lecture.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects

There were no projects or tutorials in the course. There were 3 assignments for 5% weightage each. The assignments were relatively easy and some of them involved derivations which were directly from the lecture slides. The prof. encouraged collaborative learning as well

#### Course Importance

The first half of the course is a repeat of basic thermodynamics covered in the UG courses, ME209 and ME306. The latter half is more interesting and covers IC Engines and Statistical Thermodynamics. If one wishes to get a flavour of these topics then it is recommended that they do this course. Prof Sheshadri is an expert on IC Engines so it is also recommended to do the course under him. The Prof has good industrial contacts and organizes a field visit for students during every iteration of his courses.

#### Going Forward

After learning the basics of IC Engines and Statistical Thermodynamics in this course, one can take up additional electives on fire dynamics, combustion or statistical physics from the ME or PH departments
