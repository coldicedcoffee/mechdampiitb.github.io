S3

#### Semester
Autumn '20

#### Course Difficulty
Course content was moderate in difficult but professor's teaching made it more confusing and difficult to cope up with the pace of the course.

Pre-recorded video lectures were provided which consumed approx. 2-3 hours per week. One discussion session(approx. 1 hr) was conducted for students to ask their doubts but was not compulsory. 

#### Grading Policy and Statistics
Weightages were given to assignments(10%), midsem(20%) and endsem(70%)

#### Attendance Policy
No attendance policy in online semester.

#### Pre-requisites
Nothing as such is required as a pre-req.

#### Topics Covered in the Course
Fluid statics, fluid dynamics-Navier-Stokes equation, flow in a pipe, flow over plate, losses

#### Teaching Style
Used very poor slides and the teaching style was also not up to the mark. It made people lose interest in fluid mechanics.

#### Feedback on Exams
Midsem- moderately heavy  
Endsem- difficult and time consuming
