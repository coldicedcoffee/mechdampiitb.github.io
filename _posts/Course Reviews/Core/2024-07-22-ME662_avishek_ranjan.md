#### Instructor

Avishek Ranjan

#### Semester

7th

#### Course Difficulty

3/5

#### Time Commitment Required

2-3 hours a week in addition apart from class hours

#### Grading Policy and Statistics

Since there were only 4 students registered in the course the grading was absolute. No AAs were given

#### Attendance Policy

No attendance policy but attending lectures is essential otherwise the content is difficult to follow

#### Pre-requisites

Prerequisites for this course are UG Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer courses. Without a strong background the course will be very difficult to follow.

#### Teaching Style

The prof utilized a hybrid mode of teaching wherein he covered every derivation on the blackboard and taught other concepts using lecture slides. The prof is highly knowledgeable and very approachable. He also demonstrated some experiments in his lectures to complement the theory that he had covered.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects

There was no project component involved in the course. The prof kept five graded assignments each based on key subtopics covered in the course. The assignments were easy however somewhat lengthy and calculative. One of the assignments involved coding and had a relatively higher weightage

#### Course Importance

This is an essential course for any Thermal and Fluids enthusiast. It goes into great depth starting from basic concepts and extremely mathematical in nature. Most of the correlations that were utilized throughout UG courses were derived from scratch. The course also delves in useful topics such as Tensor mathematics, Turbulence and Natural convection.

#### Going Forward

The course opens up several avenues in the domain of Thermal and Fluids engineering. After doing this course one can pursue advanced courses on Turbulence and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics

#### References

Some reference books that are recommended for this course include Convective Heat Transfer by authors Bejan and Kakac
