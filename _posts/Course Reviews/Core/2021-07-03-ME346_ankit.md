Not very difficult, but not easy either. Builds up on JEE level understanding of conduction, convection and radiation. The latter part of the course wants you to review your knowledge of fluid dynamics.

#### Time Commitment Required
4-5 hours per week apart from the usual lectures

Relative grading, not very generous but kept most people at or above 8.

No Attendance policy

#### Pre-requisites
ME219

#### Evaluation Scheme

#### Topics Covered in the Course

#### Teaching Style
Online lectures, the professor used slides and a stylus to explain things. Expected the class to be interactive and seldom gave bonus points for answering non-trivial questions.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects
Lengthy Assignments with a fortnightly frequency. No project and tuts.

#### Feedback on Exams
Lengthy but easy exams given that one has a good grip on the content.
