None

#### Pre-requisites
JEE thermodynamics

#### Evaluation Scheme
10% HWs  
25% quiz1/midsem  
25% quiz 2  
40% endsem

#### Topics Covered in the Course
• Basic concepts and definitions the work interaction  
• The first law, energy and the heat interaction  
• The zeroth law, temperature and scales of temperature  
• Properties of gases and liquids, equations of state  
• The second law, thermodynamic temperature scales and entropy  
• Relations between properties  
• Open thermodynamic systems

#### Teaching Style
Youtube links to lectures were given and doubt sessions were conducted once a week during class hours.

#### Tutorials/Assignments/Projects
Assignments were medium level. Few were given but took time to solve.

#### Feedback on Exams
All exams were alike. 40% easy, 40% medium, maybe 1 hard question and 1 question which would require reasoning and out of the box thinking.
