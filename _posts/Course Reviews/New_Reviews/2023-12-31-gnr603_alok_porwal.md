#### Instructor
Alok Porwal

#### Semester
Autumn 2023-24

#### Course Difficulty
Easy: The course content is pretty straightforward and does not require any previous knowledge in the subject.

#### Time commitment needed
Attending classes and studying just before exams is sufficient.

#### Grading Statistics
Grading statistics out of a total of 71 students:
AA 8
AB 7
BB 16
BC 12
CC 15
CD 6
DD 3
FF 4
This year's grading stats were significantly worse than previous years' stats. Relative grading was followed, with people scoring more than 80% of the topper's marks being awarded AA, more than 70% awarded AB, and so on.

#### Attendance Policy
At the beginning of the course, it was informed that 80% attendance was mandatory otherwise DX would be awarded, but it was not enforced in the end. However, attendance was taken (a sheet was passed around to sign on) in every class.

#### Teaching Style
The professor used slides to teach in class. The slides are pretty sparse, and taking notes is recommended to fill in the gaps.

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
There was only 1 assignment handed out in the first couple of weeks of the semester, and was pretty straightforward.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
The examinations were subjective and difficult in the sense that questions were not asked directly from the slides and tested one's understanding of the fundamentals of remote sensing. Even so, just studying before the exams is enough to get a decent grade in the course.
The grading of the exams is pretty arbitrary and left up to the TAs, who require a lot of persuasion during crib sessions to increase even a couple of marks.

#### Future Tracks
Future courses could be Remote Sensing and GIS Applications to Mineral and Hydrocarbon Exploration taken by the same professor. A related course for learning implementation could be Machine Learning for Remote Sensing.

#### Course Importance
This is a good course for someone wanting to pursue theoretical remote sensing. Can check the future tracks section for further courses to take up.
