#### Instructor
Prof. Tanmay Bhandarkar

#### Semester
Spring 2023

#### Course Difficulty
The concepts taught in this course are mostly very easy to understand but to do well in exams one has to really focus on solving problems as some of them can be very lengthy and it�s very easy to make silly mistakes in long calculations.



#### Time commitment needed
There is not much time required to understand concepts discussed in class however as there were 6 homeworks and solutions generally involved lengthy calculations, there was moderate to significant time commitment required outside class. 

#### Grading Statistics
Approximately 47% of the class got BB and above.

#### Attendance Policy
Attendance wasn�t recorded but since there�s not much material shared outside class, it�s important that one attends class and makes notes. Also, tutorials were in class hours and HW submissions were generally in-class.

#### Teaching Style
The professor was very approachable and explained topics pretty well, also discussing some examples along the way. He uses a lot of board and chalk while teaching so there aren�t any slides and you are highly encouraged to attend classes and make notes. The class discussions were very helpful. 

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
The tutorials were conducted in class almost once in two weeks where solutions to a few problems were discussed and these solutions had to be submitted by the end of the session. Based on each major topic, a set of questions were given as homework and were due in class. 

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
Most questions asked in the exams were easy if you had done the tutorials and homeworks well but many questions involved lengthy calculations so practice is the key to ace this course.



#### Future Tracks
ME423 - Machine Design, ME604 - Robotics, ME603 - Kinematics and Dynamics of Machinery, ME762 - Advanced Engineering Dynamics


#### Course Importance
It�s a core course for ME 3rd year UGs.

#### Additional Details
Course Highlights
The professor was very approachable. 
Gear-trains portion was very interesting.
