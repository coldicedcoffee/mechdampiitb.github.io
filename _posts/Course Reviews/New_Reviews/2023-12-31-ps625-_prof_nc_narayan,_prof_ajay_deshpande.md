#### Instructor
Prof. NC Narayan, Prof. Ajay Deshpande

#### Semester
Autumn 2023-24

#### Course Difficulty
Easy, mostly the course is just about reading and paying attention in class with concepts covered quite easy to grasp.

#### Time commitment needed
About 3 hours of classes every week, with an additional 2 hours spent outside the class per week would suffice. There were a total of 3 assignments for the midsemester and 1 project for the end semester. No exams were conducted throughout the course. 

#### Grading Statistics
AA - 6
AB- 6
BB- 4
CC- 2
CD- 1
The grading stats were quite good any minimal effort as compared to a core course would be sufficient to get a good grade.

#### Attendance Policy
None, but its the kind of elective where the professor mentions a lot of his experiences and examples in class which aren't mentioned in the slides and which are really important and interesting. There isn't that much of a point taking the course If one does not attend the classes.

#### Teaching Style
Teaching style was great, Professor had a huge amount of experience in the field and his on-ground work that he had done for the different agencies, pollution boards and companies was really interesting. A lot of the laws we were studying about he had helped formulate being a part of the committee involved in helping frame it.

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
Medium level Difficulty but requires decent effort if you want a good quality assignment, topics are quite interesting so overall doing them was fun as well.

#### Future Tracks
Could be a precursor to Circular Economy taken by the same Professor that runs in the even semester.

#### Course Importance
Doing this course would make you quite aware of how CSR functions in different corporations operate, and also aware of how legislation is done to control pollution in different forms. It also gives a broad understanding of the environmental field in general and the scope that exists there in for career prospects.

#### Additional Details
Overall, had taken the course just out of interest, was the only UG student in the entire course most of the rest of the class comprised of Phd or MTechs for whom this was a core course/ elective. Class size was relatively small about 10-12 people turned up to class regularly. If you do want a good first exposure in either policy or specifically in environment this would be a great option totally would recommend it!
