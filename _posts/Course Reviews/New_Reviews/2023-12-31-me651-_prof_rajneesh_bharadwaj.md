#### Instructor
Prof. Rajneesh Bharadwaj

#### Semester
Autumn 2023-24

#### Course Difficulty
Moderate
Ideally in 3rd or 4th year. Since the concepts of fluid dynamics (ME219) come in pretty handy. Having done, ME 346- heat transfer gives as added advantage

#### Time commitment needed
Just going to classes regularly should suffice

#### Grading Statistics
Lenient
Out of a class of 70 people, 10 AAs and 16ABs were awarded.

Grading is done in relative to the highest scorer of the class.

#### Attendance Policy
None 

#### Teaching Style
Since it is a core course for M.Tech students, the pace of the course was slow. The professor made sure to cover all the basic concepts and one could comfortably follow the lectures.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
Exam type: Subjective exams. Exams were of moderate difficulty. Quizzes were mostly from slides and tested theoretical concepts and derivations. Midsem and endsem exams focused more on numerical and application-based questions.

Grading type: Lenient, class averages were nearly 50%

Exams require you to have a good understanding of the concepts. Quizzes do a good job of keeping you on track and up to date with the syllabus. Since the course content covered wasn't a lot, exams do not demand a lot of preparation time. Being thorough with concepts and practicing sample questions provided by the professor should suffice.

#### Course Importance
Doing this course would be like a good revision of ME 219, if you want to brush up the concepts. But I don't think there is a lot of new things to learn as it's an introductory core course for M.Tech students.
