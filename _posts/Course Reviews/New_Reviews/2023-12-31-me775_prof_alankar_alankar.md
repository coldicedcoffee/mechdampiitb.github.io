#### Instructor
Prof. Alankar Alankar

#### Semester
Autumn 2022-23

#### Course Difficulty
The course was easy to moderate since the evaluation was based on mid-term take-home assignment and end-term paper. One with a decent understanding of structural materials (ME 221), especially the ideas of dislocations and slip will find the course a breeze.

#### Time commitment needed
Very little time commitment, except during the take home assignment and term paper which require decent hours of literature review (15+ papers) and report writing (can be over 15 pages as well).

#### Grading Statistics
AA - 1
AB - 1
II - 1

One shouldn't really make any judgements based on the above stats due to the very small number of people taking the course

#### Attendance Policy
None.

#### Teaching Style
Since there were 3 students, the classes were more like group discussions in which the prof would sit down with a piece of paper and all the students would try to work on the topic of discussion in a relaxed manner.

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
The take home assignment and term paper can be time consuming and some of the papers one might read can be quite complex in terms of the mathematics. Apart from that, the course is chill in the truest sense of the word.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
There were no exams :)

#### Future Tracks
A good course for those interested in material science, continuum mechanics, plasticity of materials, etc

#### Course Importance
One can get a better appreciation of crystal plasticity and some of the stuff covered in ME 221 at a more fundamental level. Also, the term paper helps one learn some crucial skills required for a researcher such as effective literature review and paper writing.
