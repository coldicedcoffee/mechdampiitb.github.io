#### Instructor
Prof. Shankar Krishnan

#### Semester
Spring 2022-23

#### Course Difficulty
Moderate - The content is application-oriented, with a good mix of assignments and projects. One should take the course after completing ME346 - Heat Transfer (ME770 runs once every two years).

#### Time commitment needed
Just attend the lectures, although the homeworks and projects are comprehensive and require additional time commitment during some times in the semester.

#### Grading Statistics
AA - 7
AB - 3
AU - 4
BB - 1

#### Attendance Policy
No attendance requirements

#### Teaching Style
The lectures are delivered in class, but the slides shared on the course's Google Drive are comprehensive.
The class is usually very interactive as the number of students is less than 20. As the course is also taken by students from other departments (electrical, chemical, etc.), there are often interdisciplinary discussions during the class.

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
The homework covers most of the concepts taught in the lectures through related problems and takes 5-6 hours to complete.
There are two projects in the course: Individual and Group. The Prof floats a list of multiple topics for both of these to choose from, and there are presentations during the last week of the semester. For the group project, the Prof gives each team a piece of electronic equipment and the team has to analyze its thermal management system.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
The midsem is take-home, where each student is given a different research paper to analyze the thermal system of the electronic given. Each student is supposed to provide an analytical solution for calculating the thermal performance of the system and suggest improvements.
The endsem is open notes, conventional and subjective. The problems are tough and involved, mostly numerical in nature. 

#### Future Tracks
The course is more of a culmination of courses related to heat transfer. 

#### Course Importance
This is the only course related to applied heat transfer and thermal management running in the institute, giving insights into the field of thermal management & electronics cooling. The projects might also give exposure to software like Ansys Fluent, COMSOL, etc. which aren't generally a part of the curriculum in most courses.

#### Additional Details
Would recommend this course to anyone who wants to explore the practical applications of heat transfer.
