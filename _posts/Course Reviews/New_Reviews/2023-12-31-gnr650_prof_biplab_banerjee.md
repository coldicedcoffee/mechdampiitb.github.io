#### Instructor
Prof. Biplab Banerjee

#### Semester
Autumn 2022-23

#### Course Difficulty
The course difficulty is quite variable, it depends on the student's expertise in Computer Vision (CV). Someone with a fair background would find the course easy and it only a little bit of time to cover up on the topics covered. On the other hand, if you have no background in CV, it get extremely difficult very quickly since the prof skims over the topics rather than go in depth.

#### Time commitment needed
Very low if you have a background in CV, otherwise medium to difficult

#### Grading Statistics
The grading was above average and students can easily get a 9 with minimal efforts

#### Teaching Style
The teaching isn't great. Prof has all kinds of logistical nightmares, often not mentioning deadlines for assignments and they themselves are extremely vague in nature

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
Assignments are very vague; Project is more or less open ended

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
Just one midsem with conceptual questions

#### Future Tracks
Any other CV courses

#### Course Importance
Can be a good intro course to CV
