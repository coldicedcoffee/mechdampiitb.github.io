#### Instructor
Prof. Dhanesh Manik

#### Semester
Spring 2022

#### Course Difficulty
The course content is quite a lot, although not very difficult. Recommended to be taken in the second year itself, as it opens up options to take up advanced courses on control theory in future semesters.

#### Time commitment needed
Apart from 3 hrs of classroom lectures each week, spending around 2 - 2.5 hrs going through the lecture material, tutorials and reference book (Ogata) is recommended. 

#### Grading Statistics
The grading of the exams was quite lenient. The final grading statistics were also quite good.

#### Attendance Policy
None

#### Teaching Style
Lecture slides were based on the book written by the Prof. himself, and were quite extensive. 

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
Tutorials (ungraded) were provided for each topic covered and contained some problems that one should definitely solve in order to do well in the exams.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
The quizzes and endsem were of moderate difficulty, but the questions were generally very calculation intensive. It is important to solve practice problems from the tutorials to do well. Grading of the exams was pretty lenient. 

#### Future Tracks
ME779 is a good introductory course on control theory and mainly covers topics in classical control theory and some topics in modern control. It is a good precursor to advanced courses on modern control and so on which are offered SysCon and other departments.

#### Course Importance
Same as above.
