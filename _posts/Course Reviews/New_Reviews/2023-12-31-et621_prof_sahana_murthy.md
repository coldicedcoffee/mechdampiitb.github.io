#### Instructor
Prof. Sahana Murthy

#### Section
Na

#### Semester
Autumn 2023-24

#### Course Difficulty
Easy course if you attend classes regularly. Can take it in any year there is no prerequisite as such.

#### Time commitment needed
3 hours of classes per week plus a few assignments that require about an hour or 2 each, throughout the course. A project at the end requires some time commitment (15 hrs approx spread over 5 weeks)

#### Grading Statistics
Equally distributed grading across all grades

#### Attendance Policy
Attendance was marked in every class although no DX was awarded. Might have been considered during the grading. 

#### Teaching Style
The teaching style was great (of course cause she's teaching how to effectively teach). Involved a lot of in-class activities, discussions and hands-on work.

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
The group project is divided into multiple stages and feedback and marks are given at each stage. The difficulty is not a lot since the topic can be selected by us but some amount of time commitment is required. 
Most assignments are to be done in class and submitted.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
Again if you attend classes regularly, preparation is very easy one day before exams. The slides are comprehensive. 
Question paper is application-based, fun and a mix of objective and subjective. 

#### Course Importance
This is an introductory course if you are interested in the education space, are looking at building an edtech startup or are just curious to know how one learns and maybe implement effective learning strategies for yourself too.
