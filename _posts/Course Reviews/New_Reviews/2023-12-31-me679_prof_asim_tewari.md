#### Instructor
Prof. Asim Tewari

#### Semester
Spring 2023

#### Course Difficulty
The content of this course is quite heavy, involving a lot of Math (Linear Algebra) and Solid Mechanics in a number of derivations. I strongly recommend not to miss any classes. Otherwise it becomes too difficult to follow the content in class or to cover on your own. 

#### Time commitment needed
Understanding notations and derivations can take some time. In fact, this is definitely not one of the �chill� electives people search for so take it only if you are genuinely interested and willing to put in time (Never miss a class!). 


#### Grading Statistics
Pretty good. Everyone got >= 8. Out of a total of 9 students :
AA - 3
AB - 2
BB - 3
AU - 1


#### Attendance Policy
There wasn�t any attendance policy but catching up would be very difficult if you even miss one class.


#### Teaching Style
The professor taught the course using the traditional black-board and chalk method and no slides or other material were shared. But the class notes were quite exhaustive and enough for preparing for exams. 

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
All exams were open book/notes. The questions were easy if you had understood all the lectures. The proofs asked in the exam were significantly less rigorous compared to proofs covered in class.


#### Future Tracks
If you like ME679, consider taking ME761: Advanced Stereology and Microstructural Analysis under the same professor in the subsequent Spring semester. You can also check courses on Composite materials offered by AE or MEMS departments.

#### Course Importance
Highly recommend this course if you are really comfortable with Linear Algebra and enjoyed ME201 and ME202 and/or are planning a DDP/BTP involving Composites/Micromechanics. It�s a plus if you are somewhat interested in Material Science.

#### Additional Details
Pre-requisites
There�s no hard prerequisite but I�d highly advise you against taking this course if you are not comfortable with linear algebra or didn�t like ME201 or ME202.

Course Highlights
First class of the course we had a Quiz!
Discussions with the professor on the Industrial Scenario was an eye-opener.
In principle, you only need to know a few letters to navigate this course (attend first few lectures to understand what I mean :))

Peers
Generally you can expect a bunch of students who are actually interested in core to take/actively participate in this course. These include - a few PhD scholars and 4th/5th year D.D. Mech, Meta and Aero students.
