#### Instructor
Prof. Shahi Ranjan Kumar

#### Semester
Spring 2022-23

#### Course Difficulty
Difficult

#### Time commitment needed
2-3 hours a week in addition to actively listening to class. The content is pretty mathematical with complex equations. 

#### Grading Statistics
For exact grading stats, refer to ASC. Although, due to the difficult of the course, it becomes very clear as the course runs since students naturally get marks in certain ranges. I wouldn't recommend sophomores to take this course for the grade.

#### Attendance Policy
No attendance policy. But it is recommended to attend.

#### Teaching Style
The prof is pretty active in class as well as office hours. He is excited about solving doubts.

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
The project part was a direct derivative of the tutorials. If you have attended the tutorials, then the project is pretty easy. The paper part consists of summarizing a journal paper. Not a big time commitment and the deadline is after endsems.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
The exams content directly came from the slides. Being thorough with the slides is pretty important to score well in the exams. 

#### Future Tracks
Having some knowledge of controls would help in the course.

#### Course Importance
This is a pretty end to end course on modelling and control systems. From what I have heard from my friends who took the course with me, it teaches you more than a UMIC controls position might teach you. Applicable for aircrafts, spacecrafts, drones, helicopters etc, it will allow you to be able to design a controller for any flying object. It also gives insight into path planning. Should really help anyone who is interested in making aerial vehicles.
