#### Instructor
Prof. Soham Mujumdar

#### Semester
Spring 2022-23

#### Course Difficulty
Easy.

The course has no prerequisites and if one attends the classes regularly, it is pretty easy to follow. The instructor teaches really well while the assignments and quizzes build on what has been taught in class. Scoring well is not tough if one goes through the lecture slides thoroughly before assessments.

I would recommend taking this course as early as possible if one has not yet completed a course in probability or statistics.

#### Time commitment needed
About an hour a week outside of classes should be enough

#### Grading Statistics
The grading was moderate to lenient. 

#### Attendance Policy
None

#### Teaching Style
The professor taught using slides with plenty of examples. The teaching style is easy to follow and the professor maintained a steady pace throughout the semester.

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
Most of the questions in the assignments can be done fairly easily barring a couple of them which might take some time. 

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
The assignments and quizzes would ensure that you are sufficiently prepared for the endsem examination. The exam was subjective and a formula sheet was provided. The grading was fair.

#### Future Tracks
Can be a good addition to a DS minor.

#### Course Importance
Great course to understand some of the nuances behind a lot of statistical analysis done in the field of data science.
