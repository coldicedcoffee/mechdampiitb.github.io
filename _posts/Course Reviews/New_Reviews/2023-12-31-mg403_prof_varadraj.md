#### Instructor
Prof. Varadraj

#### Semester
2022

#### Course Difficulty
3, It doesn't have any prerequisites, and the professor teaches from scratch. Therefore, in my opinion, it doesn't matter which year you choose to take this course.

#### Time commitment needed
In addition to the aforementioned 3 lecture hours, there will be 4 projects during the first half and a few assignments during the second. In my opinion, allocating an extra three hours each week should be sufficient to acquire new knowledge from this course.

#### Grading Statistics
The course grading will be quite lenient if you actively participate in every lecture and give your best effort on assignments and projects. The mid-term exam was lengthy, so preparing for extensive calculations would be beneficial.

#### Attendance Policy
None

#### Teaching Style
Via moodle. 

#### Feedback on Assignments/ Tutorials/ Projects
It can be hectic at times, but the difficulty level is low.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
The course is heavily focused on mathematics, with less emphasis on concepts and more on the application of formulas. The exam was subjective in nature.

#### Course Importance
Taking this course will enable you to analyze an annual report, comprehend the rationale behind corporate decisions, and apply these skills in the fields of finance and management.
