#### Instructor
Prof. Swaprava Nath

#### Semester
Autumn 2022

#### Course Difficulty
2/5 ; The content is interesting and the instructor provides videos of all lectures, keeping up with the classes and light preparation before exams is enough. I took the course in my 3rd semester but should be more suitable in the 5th semester as it is a PG level course.

#### Time commitment needed
3 hours a week, attending classes after watching videos is sufficient 

#### Grading Statistics
Very generous, most people scored BB or above, high scoring exams and lenient corrections

#### Attendance Policy
No attendance policy, very few people actually showed up to class especially after midsems

#### Teaching Style
The course is a copy of a course the professor used to teach in IITK hence, extensive content available, recorded video lectures and PyQs. Prof asked to go through videos of each week, one class used to be on summarizing and explaining the content again, one for doubts. Professor is very interactive and kept discussion interesting.

#### Feedback on Exams (Written Evaluation)
Application based exams, were allowed cheat sheets, lenient checking in exams and got marks if concept clear and if appropriate notation used

#### Future Tracks
Pre requisite for CS6002 by the same instructor which only focuses on algorithm design and is a project based course.

#### Course Importance
One of the better courses on Game theory in insti, should explore even if slightly interested. Part of DS minor basket and can be tagged as an elective due to good grading.
