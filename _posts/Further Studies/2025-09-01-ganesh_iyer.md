Credits - Ganesh Iyer, B.Tech, Mechanical Engineering(With Honours), 2025

### University
ETH Zurich

### Programs and Countries applied to 	
1) MSc in Robotics, Systems and Control, ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland
2) MSc in Robotics, EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland
3) MS in Mech. Engg., MIT, USA
4) MS in AeroAstro, Stanford, USA
5) MS in Mech. Engg., UCLA, USA
6) MS in Robotics, CMU, USA
7) MS-to-PhD in Mech, UCB, USA


### Application Timeline 	
1) TOEFL in July, GRE in Sept 
2) Asked profs for LoRs in August 
3) Completed first draft of SoP in October
4) Finalized SOP, CV in November after multiple iterations 
5) Started with Univ shortlisitng, Reserch Lab and prof finalization in August, finished in October
6) Filled all applications and submitted them 1 week before their respective deadlines (spread out around Nov end and early Dec).


### Application Strengths
1) Strongest point - Academic track record, GPA(9.87), DR(2/200), academic prizes etc
2) Internship at NTU Singapore, 12th in world, topic in robotics (relevant to my domain). Also had a paper related to the work(although was under review at time of application).
3) 2 strong LORs from iitb profs (based on course AP grade + research project), 3rd LOR from NTU prof(well known in the field).

### SOPs, LORs, Resume
1) CV is not that difficult, just a bit more elaborative for research applications compared to resume. 
2) SOP needs LOTS of time and iterations, feedback from many seniors. Start early, introspect and write your own story without any bias.
3) LORs need to be as strong as possible, from profs (or company manager etc.). Can consider tradeoff of how well known the person is in addition. Ask early on, to avoid last minute problems. Profs are busy, do not be disappointed if they don't reply, keep on sending reminders.

### Resources Used
None

### Reflections & Advice 
The standard process of application just needs to be followed timely, things should not be an issue then. Don't underestimate making SOPs, and univ/lab/prof shortlisting. Takes time. 
Also, do not get disappointed if some colleges that were among your "safe colleges" category reject you, that happens often. There is randomness involved. Who knows, you may get a college from your "ambitious" category.
