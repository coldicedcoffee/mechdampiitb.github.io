### How did you prepare for the Jaguar Land Rover internship application, both in terms of technical knowledge and soft skills?
To prepare for the Jaguar Land Rover internship application, I focused on both technical knowledge and soft skills. On the technical front, I made sure to thoroughly review the core courses, especially subjects like Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which are important because the company works with a variety of subsystems such as electric vehicles and battery systems. Fundamental knowledge of Solid Mechanics, vibrations, damping systems, as well as stress analysis was tested. It's essential not to underestimate the importance of the core subjects since the interviewers primarily want to see if you can apply theoretical concepts to real-world engineering problems.
Additionally, in the pre-interview test, basic coding skills were evaluated, where I was given a problem statement to solve through code, which was then checked against test cases. The test also assessed mental ability, emphasizing logical thinking alongside technical expertise.

### What were the key challenges you faced during the interview process, and how did you approach solving them?
The interview process at Jaguar Land Rover was both challenging and insightful. It felt like a learning experience in itself, as the focus was more on showcasing my thought process rather than just arriving at the correct answer. The interviewers were keen on understanding how I grasp problems and how I approached solving them from the ground up. For instance, I was asked about the flow in a pipe and how the friction factor changes with Reynolds number, and I had to build my solution step by step, starting with basic principles.
One of the other key aspects of the interview was the heavy emphasis on my resume. Since I had mentioned a course project related to fluid mechanics, a significant portion of the interview revolved around that, so it’s crucial to be thorough and well-prepared on everything you include in your resume.

### Can you walk us through a project or task you worked on during the internship that had a significant learning impact on you?
The project I worked on during my internship at Jaguar Land Rover was primarily driven by the company’s requirements, rather than my personal interests. However, I approached it with a positive mindset, focusing on extracting as much learning as possible from the opportunity. Jaguar Land Rover has a robust R&D culture, and employees are encouraged to participate in research alongside their regular work.
My main project was within the EV mechatronics team, which focuses on powertrain systems, involving thermal, fluid, and structural simulations. Specifically, my task was to characterize an inverter prototype, which included analysing its cooling mechanisms. The goal was to create an accurate model in a solver, based on the collected data, which could then approximate the system’s behaviour for different input data points. This hands-on experience significantly deepened my understanding of simulations and real-world applications in electric vehicle technology.

### What non-technical aspects of the internship, such as the work culture or team dynamics, influenced your experience the most?
I had a mentor and a manager assigned to me, and I was directly contributing to a live project, which gave me a sense of responsibility and involvement. The company has a flat organizational structure, which made the environment more approachable. I was seated in a local area with many cubicles, right next to senior team members, allowing me to easily connect with them whenever I had any doubts. Additionally, the India team regularly communicates with the JLR team in Britain, providing an international perspective on the projects. The emphasis on work-life balance was also commendable, making the overall experience both fulfilling and enjoyable.

### What were the biggest takeaways or lessons you gained from your time at Jaguar Land Rover, and how have they shaped your career goals?
One of the biggest takeaways from my time at Jaguar Land Rover was gaining a realistic perspective on how the corporate world operates, which was quite different from the academic environment I was accustomed to. In college, we often have a skewed view of how people work, but experiencing a 9-to-5 setting firsthand was a bit of an adjustment. I realized that it’s not just about coming up with intelligent solutions—it’s equally important to present them effectively. I learned the importance of striking a balance between completing technical tasks and communicating the key points in a clear, concise manner. This experience taught me how to distil complex information and showcase the crucial details, which has significantly shaped my approach to both work and my future career goals.
