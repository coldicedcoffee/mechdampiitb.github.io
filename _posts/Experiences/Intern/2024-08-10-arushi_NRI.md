### Where was your third year summer internship? Domain,Company and City.
My third-year summer internship was in the consulting domain at NRI, located in Gurgaon.

### Can you tell us about the work you were assigned during your internship? What were your responsibilities?
There are 3 divisions at NRI : Investment, Automotive consulting & Data Science
I was assigned to the automotive industry consulting division at NRI, where I focused on new technologies in electric vehicles (EVs) in India. NRI primarily collaborates with Japanese Fortune 500 companies, so the work often involves cutting-edge technology. 

The division I was in was determined based on expertise, and there was no option to choose. For mechanical engineers, the Automotive Industry Consulting Group (AICG) is typically the assigned division. My project was at the midway stage when I joined, focusing on the company's potential entry into the EV battery market for two-wheelers.

My responsibilities included engaging with various team members and stakeholders to gather information and contribute to the project's progress. The nature of the work required proactive interaction rather than being directly assigned tasks. I had the opportunity to work with experts from IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi, and I was also involved in projects related to carbon capture and the cosmetic industry in the USA.

The project had two main components: addressing a contractually defined problem statement and preparing a proposal pitch. Initially, the work was slow, but as the second project developed, I had to leave before its completion, which impacted my efficiency due to increasing workload.

### Describe a typical day at your internship. What tools, software or equipment you used in your work?
Being a Japanese firm, punctuality was a must. The office day began around 9:00 to 9:30 AM, with breakfast provided at the PG accommodation. Work officially started between 10:00 and 10:15 AM. I often needed to proactively ask my manager for tasks, especially since my projects were centered on new technologies, such as forecasting revenue for the next 30 years. This involved a lot of guesstimates and validation, which was crucial according to feedback from senior staff.

NRI did not provide lunch or reimbursement for it, so I relied on Zomato's 'home-cooked lunch' option. The PG offered breakfast and dinner. Work resumed at 2:30 PM, and I could leave by 5:45 or 6:00 PM. The office operated on a hybrid model: You were recommended to attend on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, while work-from-home was generally the trend on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

When senior consultants were in the office, I made an effort to engage with them and seek their guidance. Despite working in a professional environment, I found myself feeling sleepy, even though I was used to functioning on just four hours of sleep at the institute.

The internship provided ample time for personal activities, especially during the initial weeks, which were relatively relaxed. I was involved in preparatory work for international competitions and navigating complex visa applications for Europe. As the internship progressed, the workload increased and weekends were free from work. Overall, the feedback I received was positive, and the experience allowed me to balance internship responsibilities with other commitments effectively.

### What is something you didn't know would be a relevant skill to have but helped you in your internship, or what was a skill you were surprised to figure out you needed for your internship?
Excel: I hadn't anticipated how crucial Excel would be. It was essential for tasks like creating research columns and performing profit analysis for Carbon Capture projects. Learning to use Excel efficiently made calculations much easier.
Microsoft PowerPoint: Unlike Canva, PowerPoint isn't as user-friendly and doesn't focus as much on design. I had to learn formatting and presentation skills to create effective slides, which turned out to be quite important.
Python: I was surprised to find Python useful in consulting. It came in handy for analyzing data sourced from the internet. Using tools like ChatGPT and applying logical problem-solving helped in analysing data.
Additionally, NRI emphasized that mid-term and end-term evaluations were less critical for securing a pre-placement offer (PPO) compared to the overall quality of work. It was important to practice creating professional PowerPoint presentations, as NRI's decisions were based on the work produced rather than end-term presentations.
I also learned the value of professional communication and building relationships with colleagues. Initially, I was hesitant to be informal with managers, who were all men. However, I realized that establishing a comfortable, professional rapport with team members was crucial for a balanced work environment.

### Tell me about your transition to the city, accommodation(PG, hostel, rented apartment, relative's), food and transportation. Was it compensated by the company? Did they help in any way? 
The transition to Gurgaon was a bit challenging. NRI reimbursed only the flight from Delhi to Bombay and did not offer any relocation bonus, which was disappointing given their strong reputation in Japan. Finding accommodation was entirely my responsibility; the company did not assist with this.
I stayed in a paying guest (PG) accommodation, but it was crucial to avoid the cheaper options. These often had separate charges for electricity and food, which could end up costing just as much as slightly more expensive PGs that included these services. In Gurgaon, especially during the scorching summers, be prepared for intense heatâ€”I experienced a heat stroke myself.

### Your personal goals and journey and how this internship shaped/affected the same.
This internship significantly impacted my personal goals and journey. It boosted my confidence in my abilities by providing a structured environment where I could interact with people and receive positive feedback. This experience not only made me more comfortable with my skills but also reinforced my confidence in my capabilities.

### How is the work culture like at the company? 
The people at NRI are very supportive, and the work culture is excellent. Engage with colleagues and be open to collaboration

### Any memorable experience you'd like to share? 
Living alone in a new city was a memorable experience. On weekends, I either relaxed at the PG or explored Delhi, where I watched matches, movies, and visited places like Sarojini Nagar. NRI employees would often take us out for dinner on Friday nights. Socializing and unwinding, including drinking (I did not drink) on Fridays, was a common tradition in consulting.
Overall, while balancing work and personal life, it's important to ensure safety in a new city and to step out of your comfort zone, but not excessively.

### Any advice for people going to work in the same company? If you could go back, is there anything you would do differently during your internship? What advice would you give to someone looking to ensure a PPO?
The people at NRI are very supportive, and the work culture is excellent. Engage with colleagues and be open to collaboration.Rather than stressing about securing a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO), focus on gaining valuable experience and contributing meaningfully to your projects. The process is dynamic, and the company might adjust its PPO offerings based on various factors, like cost-cutting measures. Not receiving a PPO isn't the end of the world. Many have found great opportunities elsewhere after their internship.
If I could go back, I would probably spend more time building relationships with senior colleagues and understanding the company's internal dynamics better. It's important to balance work performance with networking and learning from others.
Ultimately, ensure you make the most of the internship experience and focus on your professional growth.
