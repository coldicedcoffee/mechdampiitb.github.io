### Guiding Professor
Prof. Vivek Sangwan

### Project Title
Controlled impulse transfer using UAV-pendulum system

### Field
Aerial Robotics 

### Problem Statement Description
Using a UAV and a pendulum attached to the UAV via a passive joint, the project aims to transfer precise impulse to objects. Since, the pendulum isn’t directly actuated, the motion of the pendulum is elicit using the drones motion. 

### What was your motivation for choosing this field?
Interest in robotics

### What factors did you consider while choosing professors?
Factors: Ongoing projects under the prof., calibre of the current students under his guidance, the prof. himself. 

### Duration of the project
16 months

### Overall experience
My work included working on both hardware and software. If you choose the work with prof. Sangwan, he would engage you in every aspect of research including procuring materials and negotiating prices. Sangwan is very disciplined, and as such he expects his students to be disciplined aswell, he expects the student to stay in the lab even if he’s not working on the project. He will let you have 10 days to go home in both winter and summer holidays. Other than that it’s been a fun experience in the learning aspect. 

### Key learnings
Yes. I owe both my internship and placement to my project with prof. Sangwan. This project gave me a pragmatic approach and hands on experience. 

### What course material had you gone through prior to the project?
None

### Review of the Professor
Graded out of 5:
Expectations of the prof. : 4/5
Helpfulness: 4/5
Strictness: 2/5

Prof. Sangwan expects his students to be disciplined, and when one fails to do so, he is met not with Prof. Sangwan’s strict side but with his disappointed side. Prof. Sangwan is a rising  professor, he’s managed to get in the good books of many of the higher faculty of the mechanical department. His projects involve work both on hardware and software, and he ensures his students are engaged in all aspects of research, including making presentations for fund raisers, procuring material for research.
