### Name
Chinmay Makarand Pimpalkhare

### Guiding Professor
Prof. Dnyanesh Pawaskar

### Project Title
Autonomous Crack Detection using Deep Learning on Synthetic Datasets

### Field
AI/ML 

### Problem Statement Description
Since gathering experimental data is expensive, we wish to create a pipeline to create synthetic data through FEM simulations of a cracked plate subjected to thermal boundary conditions and train a deep learning model to detect these cracks. Further, given the thermal profiles, we also wish to train a network to spit out the boundary conditions. The latter problem is commonly known as inverse modelling in heat transfer literature. 

### What was your motivation for choosing this field?
Wish to pursue higher studies in AI/ML

### What factors did you consider while choosing professors?
Choose a prof who does research in a domain you are interested in. It is better if you have done a course under them, since that way you have an idea about how they go about their work and if you can share a common wavelength with them. 

### Duration of the project
This is my BTP, so an year long project

### Overall experience
My work involves completely setting up both the data generation and the deep learning pipeline. The time I had to commit was on the average around 10 hours a week, with a standard deviation of 2-3 hours. The project wasn't difficult per se, but since I was the only person working on it, some aspects were challenging. However, I had complete freedom to explore whatever I wanted and that was a perk. Overall, it was a great experience, 

### Key learnings
It was a very good learning experience for me. Generally, even though there are a lot of course projects in the field of AI/ML, one eventually ends up finding some GitHub repo and trying to reproduce it. This experience was different because I had to start from bottom-up and finish all the aspects independently. A BTP helps if you are applying for higher studies since it shows that you have prior research experience. I cannot really comment on the topic of placements.  

### What course material had you gone through prior to the project?
A course in Machine Learning (specifically having a good understanding of CNNs) should be enough

### Review of the Professor
Prof. Pawaskar was very helpful and encouraging throughout the course of the project. As I mentioned earlier, he gave me free reign to explore topics and ideas and this really was something which made the project enjoyable. Further, the discussions I had with him were pretty insightful.

### Future plans following this project
Am continuing the project under BTP-II
